    "technical_summary": "The support consists of a large piece of somewhat coarsely woven fabric with an additional strip approximately 4.5 cm high added at the bottom, which itself consists of two pieces of a different fabric. All three pieces were sewn together prior to application of a moderately thin ground layer. On the main section the ground is tan; on the bottom strip it is gray. X-radiographs reveal a random pattern of sweeping strokes created by the instrument used to apply the ground, probably a palette knife. The paint was very thinly applied with a range of paste to fluid consistencies. The numerous pentimenti visible to the eye are not visible in x-radiographs, but can be more clearly discerned using infrared reflectography. Among the innumerable small shifts in drapery contours and figure poses, the most notable are the changes in position of Alexander's legs. Also, the supine figure at lower  left was added over different preexisting compositional elements.",

Minor pentimenti, such as small  changes in the hand on the left side of the table and in the right contour of Judas' right elbow, are also  revealed by infrared reflectography. The composition  inside the frame was blocked in with opaque, fluid paint in broad, flat areas. Slightly more full-bodied paint  was applied over this underlayer for details, ornamentation, and architectural elements. Daubs of somewhat pastose paint, quickly and surely applied, define the features, musculature, and clothing. The most prominent are daubs of white that constitute the brightest highlights. The application of  the darker valued colors in thin layers or glazes  contrasts with the thicker application of the lighter  valued colors.",

    "technical_summary": "The support is a medium-weight, plain-weave fabric prepared with a thick,  dark brown ground containing coarsely ground pigment particles. Over this was applied a reddish imprimatura that was allowed to show through in  thinly painted passages and which functions as the shading of most  figures. The design elements were laid in with freely applied, slightly thick strokes of light brown paint. The main figures  were then painted with a heavily loaded brush using thick, painterly strokes. The background was finished next, as it  overlaps the figures in some areas. Finally, contour strokes were applied to finish the figures with special attention to that of the saint. A slight contour change is discernible  along the lower edge of the Virgin's blue mantle; a small  artist's change is also visible at its lowest point near her feet.",

    "technical_summary": "The support is a gauzelike fabric. The reddish brown ground  shows through in areas of abrasion and in passages where it  was used as shading. Over the uniform ground layer are additional layers, toned to conform with the related paint layer. For example, a light-toned layer is under the sky, a darker tone is under the foreground, and a yellow layer is  under the shield. First the background was painted, using  dark brown washes; next the sky, architecture, and foreground  were added, leaving reserves for the subsequent execution of  the sculptural and \"live\" figures. The exactness of these reserves suggests that the placement and poses of the figures had been established in advance. The tonal layers,  contour strokes, and highlights were added last. The consistency of paint in the nonfigural sections varies from thin in the foreground to low impasto in the sky and architecture, and tends to be applied with blended strokes. The figures are painted with thick, fluid, unblended strokes. Pentimenti appear throughout the architecture, the sculptures, and in the trees. X-radiographs and infrared photographs reveal three figures in  the foreground, at the bottom of the fountain, which were brought  to a finished state and then painted out by the artist.",

There are two ground layers: a warm ocher-colored layer over a  white layer. The upper ground layer is visible between some  contour boundaries and in the helmet in the left foreground. The entire painting was executed simultaneously, although the wooden staffs were apparently added last. The paint  was applied in a creamy consistency that retained the  fluid brushstrokes without producing high impasto. A  wide range of opaque to glazed paints was employed.  Thin brown lines were added over the paint to emphasize contours. Small adjustments in contours and overlapping forms appear as pentimenti in normal light and as brushstrokes  under the thin surface paint in raking light. No major changes  are evident. Infrared reflectography reveals no underdrawing; however, several lines were drawn in a dry medium on a dry  underlayer to position the flagpole at the right side.",

There is a grey imprimatura beneath the figure, which is used for the shadows in the dress, and a reddish-brown imprimatura under the landscape on the right.  The painting is executed richly, fluidly, and loosely except in the flesh tones; the flesh tones are more tightly painted, blended wet into wet, with red and reddish-brown shadows; the blue drapery is underpainted with white, glazed over with deep blue, with thinner glazes in the highlights; the dress is painted creamily, with pink and brown glazes; the landscape is very fluidly painted in what appears to be a single layer over the imprimatura.  The \"signature\" has been shown to be false since it continues into cracks in the underlying paint film. The paint surface is abraded from heavy-handed cleaning, especially in the darks, and the impasto has been flattened during lining.  There is major retouching in parts of the head; large losses in the right shoulder and between the left arm and torso are inpainted; and much of the deeper shadow in the blue drapery, and the lower left of the picture, are reinforced with glazes.  The thick, natural resin varnish has discolored yellow to a significant degree.",

The composition is painted within a brown feigned oval.  The painting is executed in thin, fluid, opaque layers with semitransparent glazes in the shadows and some low impasto; glazes have been lost or have faded.  The thick, opaque paint on the bodice fastenings may originally have been modified by dark glazes, now faded. There are few losses, but the paint is abraded throughout, presumably due to overcleaning; in the face much of the paint has been abraded down to the gray ground.

The paint was applied without much medium and has a dry appearance, especially  in the white highlights. It has a more fluid consistency in the dark  shadows. The figures were created with several thin paint layers,  over which a network of dabs of thicker paint was applied. X-radiographs  reveal that reserves were left for the figures and the chairs, and that  small changes were made in the figures. The collar and right hand of the second choirmaster were slightly altered, as were the leg and  foot of the figure at far right, whose mouth was changed from open to closed.",

    "technical_summary": "The fine canvas is plain woven; it has been lined.  The ground is a translucent white with additives that may be chalk with an admixture of white lead.  The painting is executed in opaque, smoothly applied layers slightly thicker in the figure than in the background; the forms are broad and generalized, and there is little articulation of detail.  The painting has been abraded by solvent action, most noticeably in the background and dark areas.  The inscription is evidently of later date since it was painted over cracks and abrasions.  There is marked craquelure, but little retouching.  The thick, uneven natural resin varnish has discolored moderately.",

This colored ground influences the overall hue of the lighter sky, although it is not clear whether the gray layer is applied over the entire support beneath the pink-brown layer, which is not discernible in the lower half of the painting. The paint is applied fluidly and the handling is characteristic of the artist at this date. Low impasto is found in some of the highlights and details; the sky is painted more rapidly and thinly with delicate brushstrokes that reveal the underlying ground through striations in the surface layer. The paint is applied primarily wet-into-wet, although details such as the ripples of the water and the figures have been applied with liquid strokes over the dry underlying surface paint. The tile roofs of the buildings are textured with small drops of paint. The reflections of the buildings in the water are painted wet-in-wet. X-radiographs indicate that the left edge of the Porta Portello in the center of the composition has been shifted slightly.",

The ground is a thick, reddish brown layer that strongly influences the hue of the overlying paint layer, particularly in the sky. The paint was applied in layers of varying thickness with a direct and vigorous wet-in-wet technique. The main compositional elements were blocked in with fairly thin layers. The sky was painted before the buildings and the areas for these were held in reserve to be painted later, although the textured paint of the clouds and sky extends slightly under the buildings. The upper-right corner of the Doges' Palace was extended over previously painted passages of sky. A thin dark paint was employed for some of the details, and thin layers of semitranslucent dark paint were used throughout to outline and delineate forms and details of the buildings and figures. This dark paint was applied over or around sections of more thickly applied opaque paint that had already dried somewhat, as in the filigree on the facade of San Marco and the features of the small figures. Highlights on the faces were created with dabs of pink or yellow paint. The figures were applied directly over the white linear designs in the pavement, but before the thin black lines indicating the individual paving blocks.",

The figural elements were drawn in with loose and expressive brushwork. X-radiographs  reveal many parts drawn directly on the canvas with fluid strokes. Other areas - the mountains and sky,  for example - were painted with numerous short, brushy strokes that produce areas of texture rather than linear outlines.  Some areas show a lack of finish or incorrect drawing, such as the foot of the putto at upper left and the legs of the  putto at lower right next to Bacchus. X-radiographs reveal  that the original composition included a ledge along the bottom edge of the canvas with griffins gripping balls at either end.  A column entwined with acanthus leaves and an entablature closed  the right side of the composition, and probably also the left.  These elements were painted out before the crouching figure of Rhea at lower left was added, apparently at a later date; there  are also remnants of a darker layer over this figure.",

The brilliant blue sky was laid in first, and then clearly defined clouds were applied in heavier impasto. Next the architecture and foreground were painted with smaller brushes; broad darks and lights were laid in first and modified with halftones applied with little blending. Mechanical aids were used to incise guidelines for the architecture and perspective and the medallions on the base of the Colleoni monument. Linear details of the buildings in sunlight were incised with a straight edge into the wet paint, revealing the pale yellow layer beneath. Linear details in the shadows were painted in black with an extremely fine brush. The figures, boats, and other details in the foreground were applied upon the completed understructure.",

    "technical_summary": "The canvas is plain woven; it was lined in 1924.  The paint and ground continue over the tacking edges and are severely broken at the foldovers, indicating that the picture has been reduced in format.  The ground is white, fairly thickly applied.  There is a warm gray imprimatura, which is used as an intermediate tone in the face.  The painting is executed very thinly, in fluid, opaque paint; the handling is very direct, with forms represented by \"drawn\" lines of fluid paint and modeling constructed with unmodulated additions of paint. The thick, lumpy glue used in lining has caused corner draws, bulges, and buckling throughout.  The paint surface has been abraded in the darks and in the background, and much of the left background has been repainted; the lower portion of the mouth and the sitter's right eyebrow, eyebrow fold, and outer corner of the eyeball have been heavily retouched.  The thick, natural resin varnish has discolored yellow to a significant degree.",

    "technical_summary": "The support is a plain-weave, medium coarse fabric. The double  ground consists of an initial red layer covered by a yellow layer,  which was brushed on thickly overall and has a pebbled texture.  The paint was applied in thick, heavy layers that are highly opaque and do not allow the color of the ground to show through.  The broad, textured brushstrokes, applied wet-into-wet, produced  a moderate to heavy impasto. The borders between different compositional elements are not blended, but are often defined by a fluid contour line. The drapery was executed with thick,  heavy strokes compared to the fainting woman's thinly painted  fingers, which are articulated with finely textured strokes  and outlined with a liquid stroke of brown-red glaze. In  some areas, such as the ornaments on her shoulder, dry paint  was dragged across the surface. X-radiographs reveal that the arch behind the figures was slightly modified and the head of the crowned figure has been shifted to the right.",

The paint was smoothly and fluidly applied with quite small brushes for the figures and the architectural details. The basic forms  were applied as a smoothly blended and modeled lower layer over which the highlights, shadows, and finer details were added,  often with unblended, precise strokes, and with the aid of a  straightedge for the architectural details. The overlying  detailing of certain figures was applied so summarily that they appear unfinished; the old man with the walking stick at lower left and the man in the bright blue cape in the far left distance are examples.",

Details and overlying  shadows were dragged wet-into-wet over these larger areas  as fine lines of color or as partially blended strokes of color in which the texture of the brushstrokes remains  visible. X-radiographs show extensive and often confusing artist's changes. Thin dry scumbles or smooth thin layers were applied over these and their texture allowed to show through. The clearest changes are seen in the large, light area behind Daphne's head, which may have been a mass of  drapery or a branch; in the position of Daphne's right arm,  which may have been higher; the raising of Daphne's left knee and in her left leg, which is now shown as a tree trunk; in  the forms of the clouds; and over Apollo's left shin, where a bit of drapery was painted out.",

    "technical_summary": "The medium-weight, plain-woven canvas is composed of two pieces of linen with a vertical seam to left of center; it has been lined.  The ground is pinkish brown, thickly applied, masking the weave of the canvas.  A thin white imprimatura has been applied locally beneath the red dress of the woman seated on the right.  The painting is executed in thin, opaque, enamellike layers, with virtually no impasto and minimal texture; the brushwork is smoothly blended in the sky and grass, and loosely and fluidly applied in the costume, with light, delicate brushstrokes in the lace flounces and jewelry; the tonality of the ground layer shows through in areas such as the sky and passages in the trees. The painting has suffered heavily from losses and abrasion, and extensive areas in the sky, foliage, and landscape have been retouched; the face of the woman on the left has been traversed by a vertical line of damage.  During conservation between 1934 and 1951 a horse standing in profile in the center left was painted out owing to damage in this area, and the face of the little girl on the right was repainted.[1] It is possible that a kite (removed before the picture was acquired by Paul Mellon) was added at the same time, as the little girl on the left is described in Christie's sale catalogues of 1951 and 1955 as flying a kite; the shape is evident to the naked eye in place of the flowers the girl is holding, but it is not revealed (as the horse is) by infrared reflectography or x-radiographs.  The moderately thick natural resin varnish has not discolored significantly.",

The ground is basically red under the dark tones and gray under the lighter tones, except for red under the white-gloved hand. The paint was applied in a rich consistency with strong evidence of the brushstrokes and a general concern  with the texture of paint. The application was both wet-over-dry and wet-into-wet in the top layers, especially in the face. Additional texture was produced by using the butt end of the brush  to scratch into the wet paint. This was done exclusively to  emphasize the folds in the black cloak and does not appear elsewhere. These \"incised lines\" create an impasto and reveal the red ground; they are visible to the naked eye, but are much more dramatically evident in x-radiographs.",

    "technical_summary": "The support is a fine plain-weave fabric of medium weight, prepared with a light red ground of medium thickness. The paint has been applied with fluent brushwork and the handling reveals considerable variety in touch and application. In many places in the landscape and fortress the paint has been applied with strong brushstrokes, employing fairly thick paint to vary thickness and texture. The deliberate use of a fairly dry brush to create texture is particularly evident in the fortress. The upper-right edge of the escarpment was originally placed 4 cm to the right of its present location; indications of this change are faintly visible. In contrast, the sky has been painted more loosely and rapidly, the broad, sweeping strokes imparting  a sense of active weather, light, and movement. The thinner application of paint in the sky has permitted the red ground to show through, although in certain areas the aging of the paint, previous varnish removals, and abrasion have revealed more of the red ground than was originally intended. Aside from minor abrasion in the sky and trees in the lower-left foreground, the painting is in exceptional condition. It was treated in 1992 by Bruno Heimberg at the Doerner Institute, Munich, prior to acquisition. Additional conservation treatment, including varnish removal and in painting, was carried out by David Bull in 1993.",

    "technical_summary": "The canvas is plain woven; it has been lined, and was relined in 1944.  The ground is thinly applied; its color is difficult to determine.  The painting is executed thinly, with thicker paint in the flesh tones and impasto in the highlights of the dress and bouquet.  The blue background was applied beneath the hair, and is revealed, through losses in this area, to have been intense in color; it is uncertain whether this was the intensity of blue intended by Reynolds for the sky, or whether it was to be toned or glazed to give the somber tone it has now.  The paint surface seems to have been abraded.  Some of the flesh tones may have faded.  There is some retouching, but there are also scattered losses overall that have not been inpainted.  The natural resin varnish has discolored yellow to a significant degree.",

The smaller details in the distance were painted directly over the blue-white of the sky. The figures and the foreground were painted at the same time.",

Examination by  infrared reflectography suggested that the composition was laid out with paint containing carbon black pigments. It also revealed that numerous  compositional changes were made during the evolution of the final design: the sitter originally leaned against  what appears to be the back of a chair; her bottom lip  was originally lower than its present position; her hand  was added after the costume was completed.",

    "technical_summary": "The support is a tightly woven plain-weave fabric  of rather coarse texture with thick threads. The  primary ground is a red layer that covers the entire surface of the fabric. A secondary yellow layer was  applied over the center of the surface, leaving a border approximately 5 cm wide around the edge. Air-path  x-ray fluorescence and analysis of cross-sections shows  that the red layer consists of red and yellow iron oxides. The yellow layer is in fact two layers of different colored pigments, and appears to be lighter in color under the  figures; these yellow layers are a mixture of iron-oxide-based pigments and lead white.",

    "provenance": "Possibly Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria [1745-1777]. Traditionally said to have been brought into France by the early 19th century by Général de Saint-Maurice. M. Maillet du Boullay, Paris; (his sale, Hôtel Drouot, Paris, 22 January 1870, no. 1); M. Féral. Gustave Rothan, Paris, by 1874;[1] (his sale, Galerie Georges Petit, Paris, 29-31 May 1890, no. 122). Adèle, 4th duchesse de Dino [née Adèle Livingston Sampson, 1842-1912; married first to Frederick W. Stevens], Paris, by 1907; probably by inheritance to her daughter, Countess Mabel Stevens Orlowski [married 1891 to Count Mieczyslaw Orlowski (1865-1929)];[2] (Wildenstein & Co., Inc., Paris, New York, and London); sold 1942 to the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, New York; gift 1946 to NGA.[1] The early provenance of this painting and NGA 1946.7.1 is based on tradition rather than documentary evidence, and derives from Paul Mantz, \"La Galerie de M. Rothan,\" Gazette des Beaux-Arts (1873): 442, who believed the pair had been painted for the Elector of Bavaria, Maximilian III Joseph. They were then supposedly returned to France in the early nineteenth century by General de Saint-Maurice, who, according to André Michel, François Boucher, Paris, n.d.[1906]: 51, kept them for some sixty years before selling them to Maillet du Boullay. As Alastair Laing has pointed out, however, Saint-Maurice never served in Bavaria and died in 1796 (letter of 20 April 1997 to Richard Rand). Nor do any references to the paintings appear in the state archives of Bavaria; see Colin Eisler, Paintings from the Samuel H. Kress Collection: European Schools Excluding Italian, Oxford, 1977: 318, who offered the possibility that they were commissioned by Joseph von Dufresne, a courtier of the Elector who had a large collection of French pictures (see also correspondence in NGA curatorial files). Mantz writes that Rothan acquired the pair of paintings in 1870, probably at Maillet du Boullay's sale; Rothan certainly owned them by 1874, when he lent them to an exhibition in Paris.[2] The Wildenstein prospectus for the pair of paintings listed the last three owners as Mme. Livingston-Sampson, Duchesse de Dino, and Comte Orllowski [sic]. Research for the Gallery's systematic catalogue of 15th-18th century French paintings determined that the first two names were the same person, and that the Count was her son-in-law. See NGA curatorial files for the prospectus and documentation of the family history.",

The ground is grayish white, of moderate thickness.  The painting is executed smoothly, fluidly, and fairly thickly, with low impasto.  Visible to the naked eye is an old, horizontal, retouched tear about 10 cm.  long extending in from the right edge slightly above the rocks.  The overall craquelure was inpainted in 1984; the abrasion in the horse's rump and in the dark foliage above the horse's tail was glazed over at the same time; although the original and lining fabrics are somewhat fragile, the restoration of 1984 did not include relining.

Clarke [1848-1931], New York, as a portrait of Ruth Cunningham by Robert Feke;[1] sold by Clarke's executors to (M.  Knoedler & Co., New York), from whom it was purchased 29 January 1936, as part of the Clarke collection, by The A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, Pittsburgh; gift to NGA, 1947.",
    "technical_summary": "The canvas is finely plain woven; it has been lined, and there is an interlayer fabric between the two supports.  The painting has been enlarged at the top with a strip of additional fabric 6.5 cm.  wide.  The ground is white, and is coarse and granular.  The painting is executed in thin glazes in the hair, the shadows of the flesh and drapery, and the red brocade of the chair back, and in thicker, more opaque layers in the flesh tones and highlights of the costume, with slight impasto in the white fringe of the shawl.  The \"signature\" has been shown to be false since it continues into cracks in the underlying paint film. The paint surface has been severely abraded throughout, especially in the thinly applied glazes in the shadows of the face and hands and in the hair.  The abraded eyes, nose, and lips have all been reinforced, and numerous scattered losses in the head have been infilled.  Some areas of the drapery have been heavily retouched, and the background has been almost completely repainted.  The natural resin varnish has discolored yellow to a moderate degree.",

The ground is an extremely thin reddish brown layer that does not cover the wood texture and is unevenly applied, being thinnest at the edges. The paint is of fluid consistency with a granular appearance due to  large and irregular pigment particles. The sky was laid in before the cityscape using a continuous layer of blue and white over  the red ground with splattered dots of deep blue throughout. X-radiographs reveal areas where the artist covered over additional  clouds with blue sky. The brushwork is vigorous and free and  allows the ground to show in selected areas. Following the sky, the  water and architecture were laid in using washes with the ground  exposed to create areas of shadow; architectural details were drawn in with calligraphic strokes of black paint. The foreground  figures, boats, and highlights were painted last with a full brush. The lighter valued areas are painted with a softly rounded  rather than sharp-edged impasto.",

In the buildings the paint is applied tightly  and thinly, while in the figures and highlighted architectural elements it is handled somewhat more loosely and with slight  impasto. In general, the paint is applied in opaque layers with almost  no glazing. The black lines that define architectural details  were drawn with a straightedge. Ruled diagonal lines of underpaint in the foreground may have been used to establish the perspective.  The tower was formerly about 1 cm wider on each side as can  be seen in x-radiographs and from the vertical brushstrokes  where the sky was painted over the sides of the tower.",

The ground is white, probably containing white lead, smoothly and evenly applied and of moderate thickness.  The painting is executed thinly and very fluidly (possibly with an admixture of resin to the oil to increase fluidity) blended wet into wet; the features and costume are articulated with finely drawn touches of rich, opaque paint, with some impasto in the white highlights.  There is a slight pentimento in the positioning of the man's right knee; the girl's pink skirt can be seen beneath the paint of the breeches.  There is some solvent abrasion in the darks and the impasto has been flattened during lining; there is a substantial area of retouching in the hem of the lady's apron close to the girl's skirt, and the large cracks through the man's face have been inpainted. The most recent varnish is synthetic, slightly toned with black pigment; residues of the earlier, unevenly removed natural resin varnish have discolored yellow to a significant degree.",

    "technical_summary": "The lightweight canvas is plain woven; it has been lined.  An x-radiograph reveals cusping along the bottom edge, evidence that the painting has not been cut down.  The ground, presently whitish brown possibly due to absorption of darkened media, may originally have been pure white and is exceptionally thin. The painting is executed in thin, translucent layers with more opaque paint in the lights of the flesh tones and sky and some areas of the foliage; thin layers of media-rich glazes have been applied in the costume and foliage.  An area of original paint at the extreme bottom edge, which has been protected from the damaging effects of light by the rabbet of the frame, indicates that a rich deep red glaze was originally employed in the drapery and has faded considerably; the red glaze was probably used in the flesh tones as well.  There are moderate retouchings in the face and neck, perhaps as a result of abrasion damage.  The natural resin varnish has discolored yellow to a considerable degree.",

Losses in the underlying paint layer were filled before the surface  composition was applied. The surface paint was applied thinly, except in the whites  and highlights, which show a somewhat thicker buildup of paint. Pigment analysis using polarized light microscopy found ultramarine  ash, vermilion, red lake, van dyke brown, yellow ocher, charcoal black,  lead white, chalk, and quartz.[1]",

    "technical_summary": "The very fine, tightly plain-woven canvas was originally rectangular in format but was cut down to an oval size at a later date.  Subsequently the painting was enlarged again, once more to a rectangular format, by means of lining onto a rectangular auxiliary canvas.  Because the oval composition was slightly below the center point of this new rectangular format, the painting was later cut down along the bottom edge, and perhaps relined.  The ground of the original canvas is white, thinly applied; a thicker white ground was applied to the added canvas, masking the weave.  The original painting was executed thinly and fluidly with slight impasto in the highlights of the pearls and dress.  The paint surface has been abraded overall, severely in the feathers, and the impasto has been flattened slightly during lining; there are no major losses. The thick natural resin varnish has discolored yellow to a considerable degree.",

The ground is not discernible through the discolored varnish and thick paint layers, but is probably white.  The painting is richly executed in a complex of different layers and techniques.  The lowest paint layer is gray; the middle layers are thickly applied, white in the lights, the drapery, and background, and dark in the tree trunks, foliage, and shadows; the final layers defining detail contain nonoil additives and include rich brown, red, and blue glazes in the foliage, sky, and landscape, and in parts of the figures.  The painting seems to have been retouched and revarnished by Reynolds in 1789.[1] There are many shallow, overpainted losses throughout the painting.  Broad craquelure marks most of the dark, rich browns, indicating the presence of bitumen.  The varnish, which appears to be a natural resin, is difficult to distinguish from the final glazes and has discolored yellow to a significant degree.",

    "technical_summary": "The support is a somewhat coarse, medium-weight, plain-weave fabric.  The ground is a pinkish layer containing coarse white particles  distributed throughout, but most evident in the sky. The paint was relatively thinly applied, although the whites are somewhat thicker. In many areas the top paint layer was applied over a flat violet-colored layer that shows most clearly in the buildings and some of the boats. To paint the buildings the artist first  blocked in the facades using muted, often translucent tones over the violet layer, then drew in the windows and details that give them shape with black lines. The boats, docks, and figures in the right foreground were painted over the completed water.",

    "technical_summary": "The medium-lightweight canvas is fairly tightly twill woven; it has been lined. The ground is white, of moderate thickness.  The painting is boldly executed in fluid, broad layers, ranging from thick impasto in the lights, with some palette-knife applications, to thin, dry scumbling and glazes.  The texture of the paint is buttery, and it may contain nonoil additives.  There are pentimenti in the folds of the sleeves around the forearms, below the sitter's left shoulder, and in the contours of the hair, and a plume or decoration at the top center of the hair seems to have been painted out.  The paint layers are in poor condition owing partly to Reynolds' experimental painting techniques and partly to insensitive past restoration.  There is extensive abrading and the impasto has been flattened during the linings; there is extensive overpainting in the severe traction crackle in the darks, which was caused by the presence of bitumen.  The natural resin varnish has discolored yellow to a significant degree.",

    "technical_summary": "The canvas appears to be finely twill woven; it has been lined, probably at the time it was sold to Paul Mellon.  The ground is white, of moderate thickness. The painting is executed thinly, smoothly, and precisely, with drier, thicker highlights.  There are slight pentimenti in the female figure:  the upright fingers of her left hand were originally placed about 1 cm.  to the right, and her right hand was further to the left; vague forms below her arms and around her profile suggest that there were also slight changes in these areas.  The paint surface is slightly abraded, and has been flattened during lining.  There are several large areas of discolored retouching.  The thick synthetic resin varnish has discolored slightly.",

    "technical_summary": "The somewhat coarse canvas is plain woven; it has been lined.  The ground is white, smoothly applied and of moderate thickness.  There are thin layers of grey and brown imprimatura except in the area to be occupied by the head.  The painting is executed in thick, opaque layers, blended wet into wet, with slight impasto in the whites; only the details of the features are defined crisply over a dried underlayer.  Some change in the color of the satin cloak is suggested by the presence of deeper reds beneath the pink of the lower portion.  An x-radiograph confirms slight pentimenti in the fall of the drapery folds.  There is slight solvent abrasion and flattening of the impasto during lining, a large area of retouching in the neck, and pronounced traction crackle in the brown foliage caused by bitumen, which has been infilled.  The slightly pigmented natural resin varnish has been applied over residues of a deeply discolored coating most marked over the bituminous foliage at lower right.",

A reddish brown isolating layer serves as the ground for the surface composition. The paint was quite thinly  applied, with only the whites being somewhat thicker. The cool tonality was produced in part by scumbling light colors over dark, in some cases directly over the ground. Dark brown glazes were used throughout as well as fine lines of black paint for the architectural detailing.",

The reduction in size, at most two centimeters, has taken place in a greater degree along the top and right edges, perhaps in an effort to place the figure very slightly more centrally in the composition.  The ground is light in color and is a fairly dense substance.  The painting is executed in layers blended wet into wet, using glazes and scumbles, with impasted highlights; the heaviness of the paint varies from thin washes to thick impasto; the brushwork is prominent in the paint film.  Pentimenti are visible in the sash, the wrap, and the lower left area of the sitter's dress. There are scattered retouchings throughout the painting and drying cracks, particularly prevalent in the sitter's dress.  The heavily applied natural resin varnish has discolored yellow to a significant degree.",

    "technical_summary": "The plain-weave fabric was prepared with an underlying dark red layer and a second, buff-colored ground. This buff color was allowed to show through in the architecture, sky, and water. The artist began by painting  the cityscape: he sketched it in first with painterly contour lines, then added blocks of color, and finally used thin lines of black and white for the details. Figures were painted over the landscape and architectural elements. The blue sky was laid in after the cityscape, but directly  over the ground, and the clouds were added over the sky. The whites  and lighter colors were applied quite thickly, the darks thinly. In x-radiographs it appears that the house in the center was moved  downward and that the dome of the church on the left had been  planned to be much taller.",

The painting is executed very fluidly, generally in an exceptionally rapid and painterly manner, with the ground used as a middle tone.  The hair and flesh tones are extremely thinly painted, with the details of the hair applied in feathery blues, blacks, and yellows, and the features indicated in strong tints of red and blue; by contrast, the hands are very richly modeled.  There are slight pentimenti in the contours of the shoulders, especially the right shoulder.  The paint surface gives the impression of having been abraded, but this is due to Gainsborough's technique. Apart from a fairly large area of retouching in the trees immediately to the left of the sitter's right shoulder, and scattered small retouchings, the painting is in excellent condition.

The picture has been very slightly enlarged by lining; there is a one-quarter-inch band of repaint along the left and bottom edges, and a thin border of retouching along the other edges.  The ground is white, of moderate thickness.  The painting is executed in very rich, fluid paint, applied first in thin washes, then increasingly opaquely, with some impasto in the highlights.  The paint surface has been slightly flattened during lining.  The large proportion of medium used resulted in traction crackle on drying, which has been retouched in the darks and in the face of the duchess.  The recent natural resin varnish, lightly pigmented with black, has discolored yellow slightly.",

The painting is executed in thin, fluid, opaque layers, with slight texture in the thicker whites and yellows; the forms are drawn rather than painted, and the application is linear and flat, the modeling being accomplished by a simple juxtaposition of differently valued paints.  The painting is in fairly good condition.  The paint surface is not abraded, but there is scattered discolored retouching.  The moderately thick natural resin varnish has discolored yellow to a moderate degree.",

The background was blocked in, leaving open the area to be filled by the figure. The painting is executed in very fluid, opaque layers, blended wet into wet in the flesh tones and much of the hair, but with the features, details, and final highlights added over the dried base layer.  The paint surface is heavily abraded and pitted.  There are extensive retouchings and reglazing from at least two restorations.  The natural resin varnish, pigmented with black, has discolored yellow; there are residues of an earlier deep brown varnish.",

There are pentimenti in the hind legs of the dog in the foreground and the two dogs on the left, which were originally outstretched, and in the right arm of the whipper-in, originally held downward.  The paint surface is solvent abraded and the impasto has been flattened during lining.  The traction crackle in the richer areas suggests the presence of bitumen.  There is extensive retouching over flake losses in the sky at upper left.  The residual older varnish is very darkened, and the more recent pigmented natural resin varnish has discolored slightly.",

    "technical_summary": "The medium-lightweight canvas is twill woven; it has been lined.  There are stretcher creases along the top, left, and bottom edges; the variance in distance between each crease and the edge of the painting, and the absence of a crease along the right edge, suggest that the painting has been cut down on these three sides.  The ground is white, of moderate thickness, and almost masks the weave of the canvas.  Layers of gray and pale-brown paint observed beneath the surface paint of the clouds and sky suggest that an imprimatura has been selectively applied.  The painting is executed in thin, multiple, opaque layers in the figures with some thicker brushwork but without high impasto; the foreground and background landscape is rendered in dark translucent layers with opaque touches for details of the foliage.  The paint surface is moderately abraded and has been flattened slightly during lining.  There is a considerable degree of traction crackle throughout, suggestive of the presence of bitumen; this has been extensively overpainted, and there are losses to the paint surface.  There are also extensive retouchings in some of the principal features, such as the dog and details of the hands, drapery, and background. The natural resin varnish has discolored yellow slightly.",

There is an original surface coat of animal glue.  The painting was described by William Rossetti in 1863 as \"fearfully dilapidated.  \"[1] The paint is abraded and is actively flaking and cleaving; the surface coat has discolored to a very significant degree and has begun to delaminate from the paint.  Extensive watercolor inpainting was carried out in 1938;[2] further watercolor inpainting was done in 1965, 1968, and in the early 1980s.  The wax varnish has discolored gray.",

    "technical_summary": "The exceptionally fine canvas is plain woven; it has been lined.  The ground is white, thinly applied.  The painting is executed in glue tempera (characteristic of Blake's technique), applied in thin, multiple glazes in the figures and in thicker, opaque layers in the dark background; the drapery and details of the figures are applied in stiff, textured paint modified by thin overlying glazes. The painting is very fragile.  The canvas is dessicated and brittle; the lining is dry and stained on the reverse; there is minute cleavage throughout the ground and paint layers, caused by contraction of the brittle glue medium.  The much darkened varnish was removed and flaking paint fixed with wax when the painting was restored, between 1949 and 1951 for the William Blake Trust.  There is a considerable amount of overpaint throughout, applied with minute brushstrokes.  The slightly toned natural resin varnish has discolored yellow to a moderate degree.",

The painting is broadly executed in thick, opaque layers; the paint is blended wet into wet in the flesh tones, but more loosely and sketchily applied over dried underlayers elsewhere; the texture of the paint is not descriptive of the material depicted and the brushwork is generalized. The picture is abraded overall, apparently by overcleaning, and there is extensive retouching, notably in the flesh tones; the background darks are extensively reglazed.

    "technical_summary": "The medium-weight canvas is twill woven; it has been lined, but the tacking margins survive intact.  The present stretcher is presumably larger than the original stretcher as there is an eighth of an inch of unpainted canvas visible along the top and right edges.  The ground is slightly off-white, thinly applied.  The painting is executed both thinly and thickly, with impasto especially evident in the whites; Lady Mary's gown and veil are broadly handled, but more worked than the background, with the shadows painted both under and over the white; much of the foliage is quickly and drily painted.  The heads have been heavily reworked by the artist, and the smooth paint in these passages masks the prominent weave of the canvas.  Lady Mary's right arm has been repositioned, as has the ribbon on her cap.  The paint is abraded in places, and some of the impasto has been slightly flattened during lining.  There is a prominent craquelure and discolored though not extensive retouching, especially disfiguring in the child's dress.  The natural resin varnish has discolored to a moderate degree.",

The painting is executed in very thin, transparent glazes in the darks; the sky is more opaquely rendered; moderate impasto is used in the highlights, especially in the waves.  X-radiographs reveal pentimenti in the rowing boat:  the boat was originally 2 cm. longer at the bow; the figure in the stern, now leaning over the side of the boat, originally sat with his back to the spectator; a rowing figure in the center of the boat has been painted out; the figure at the bow of the boat originally sat facing the spectator.  The picture is very abraded in numerous thinly painted areas, and has been extensively retouched with small, feathered repaints that have darkened considerably.  The moderately thick natural resin varnish has discolored yellow-brown to a significant degree.",

A deep reddish brown glaze applied throughout to cover cracks, probably during an early restoration, was removed in large part from the head and cravat and thinned elsewhere when the painting was lined, restored, and revarnished in 1956; a deep blue-black glaze similarly applied to cover cracks in the collar has been abraded.

The painting is executed in quite thick, opaque layers with impasto in the highlights; there is a transparent red glaze in the uniform.  There is fairly extensive discolored retouching, principally in the glazed areas of the uniform, but also, most disturbingly, in the sitter's right cheek, to cover drying craquelure (suggestive of underlayers not having been allowed to dry properly before the upper layers were applied).  The varnish has discolored yellow to a significant degree.",

The ground is light beige.  The painting is executed in rich, fluid, translucent scumbles with thicker wet into wet blending in the sky and whites, and some palette-knifelike passages in the tree trunk and interstices of the foliage on the left; the ground is used as a middle tone.  The paint surface is slightly solvent abraded and has been very slightly flattened during lining; paint losses are minimal. The older natural resin varnish has been partially removed from the trees and foliage and completely removed in the sky.  The moderately thick top layer of synthetic varnish has not discolored.",

Infrared reflectography reveals rather complete drawing defining the hands, the ribbons on the hats, and the edges of the dresses and indicated changes in the lengths of the sleeves. Photographs taken prior to the 1946 and 1960 treatments reveal extensive paint loss and flaking of the paint layer. Many of the losses have been inpainted, and the inpainting has reinterpreted the folds in the curtain and the clouds in the sky.",

Fox White Gallery, London), by 1882;[3] sold to (Wallis & Son, London); purchased 1893 by Peter A.B. Widener, Philadelphia, and Lynnewood Hall, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania; inheritance from Estate of Peter A.B. Widener by gift through power of appointment of Joseph E. Widener, Elkins Park; gift 1942 to NGA.[1] The Gallery's painting is the first of the artist's full-scale sketches for his six-foot canal scenes. The finished painting based on this sketch is now in The Frick Collection, New York.",
    "technical_summary": "The medium-coarse canvas is tightly plain woven; it has been lined at least twice.  The ground is white lead and chalk.  There is a tan-colored imprimatura. X-radiographs made in 1984 reveal that the work is executed, comparatively thinly, over an unfinished (but fairly complete) painting of Dedham Vale from the Coombs; they also show pentimenti in Willy Lott's cottage, which was originally positioned at the same angle as in the finished picture in the Frick Collection, and around the horse and barge.  There is no lead white ground between the two paintings.  Both paintings are executed broadly and sketchily with some passages in impasto.  The paint layers have been compressed and the impasto flattened to an unusual degree in the course of linings, the last of which was in 1948.  For a combination of reasons apparent from this summary the paint structure is hard to examine, but it seems likely that there was extensive damage and repainting at an early date.  The gray-purple tone over most of the sky appears to be a later glaze applied over abraded paint; there is repainting in the white horse, the figure to its left, the cows, the foliage, and the water.  Worn areas in the sky at right, numerous separation cracks, and an old tear in the foreground center were treated in 1949.  There is a 34-cm.  crack near the top edge, corresponding to the bottom edge of the top stretcher member. The unusually thick natural resin varnish has discolored yellow to an exceptional degree.",

The paint was applied using tight and smoothly blended brushstrokes, with low impasto only evident in the white ruffles and the forehead.

    "technical_summary": "The medium-fine canvas is plain woven; it has been lined.  The top of the canvas has been cut down and folded over and later torn off, and the top inch of the picture is on a separate fabric strip which has been painted subsequently (this in turn has been folded over).  The ground is white, of moderate thickness. There is a thin streaky brown imprimatura.  The painting is executed sketchily, leaving large areas of the imprimatura revealed, and worked with impasto and scrubbing; the paint layers in much of the landscape are blended wet into wet, with many of the smaller details added as dabs of paint over a dried underlayer. The impasto has been flattened during lining.  Repainting in the sky at upper right and along the bottom edge center was adjusted in 1948.  The moderately thick natural resin varnish has discolored yellow to a significant degree.",

An extensive preparatory sketch of the composition has been drawn in with a red pencil or crayon and reinforced with liquid black paint applied with a brush; unlike the underdrawing of the trees, the underdrawing of the architecture is incorporated into the surface design and is clearly visible. The painting is executed in thin, opaque layers in the landscape, architecture, and sky; some of the foliage and areas of the foreground are applied in translucent glazes; the highlights are slightly textured.  There is a pentimento in the tree on the right, which originally had a broader trunk.  The paint surface is very slightly abraded throughout; apart from a damaged area of sky just beneath the lowest branches of the tree on the right, which has been retouched, the paint losses are minimal.  The thin natural resin varnish has not discolored.",

    "technical_summary": "The medium-weight canvas is plain woven; it was lined in 1968.  The ground is white.  There is a very thin and transparent warm brown imprimatura.  The painting is rapidly and deftly executed in fluid, opaque layers, blended wet into wet, the light passages in rich paint, the dark areas much thinner. X-radiographs show that the ring suspended from the sitter's waist has been shifted slightly to the left.  The sitter's right hand is heavily retouched; the retouching lies over the remains of black, suggesting that the hand had been painted out by the artist, that the artist's black paint was removed during a subsequent restoration, and that the form then had to be reintegrated.  The paint is somewhat solvent abraded in the background and in the pure blacks, and the impasto was very slightly flattened during lining.  There is extensive retouching in the background, and scattered retouching carried out in 1968.  The dammar varnish applied in 1968 has not discolored.",

Over a thin, white ground layer, the paint was rapidly applied in several, often thick layers. Details in the chickens were applied in broad brush strokes with some fairly high impasto to represent the feathers and highlights in the heads and feet. The layering appears to be wet-into-wet as well as wet-over-dry, and glazes were used in the areas of thicker feathers. The painting is in poor condition, probably resulting from environmental conditions and from an unsound technique. X-radiography reveals large areas of loss, particularly at the bottom edge, top center, and right, and in the  tail feathers of the chicken on the left. The entire right side suffers from numerous small losses. The dark background  appears to have been entirely repainted. The varnish has become severely discolored.",

The painting is executed in a variety of complex techniques.  Smooth, opaque layers are used for the sky and river; the background buildings are rendered in fairly thin, opaque paint, while the rest of the design is constructed in multiple layers of glazes, especially thin and liquid in the trees; there is stiff impasto in the highlights, and occasional sgraffito marks created with a blunt instrument are evident in the tree trunk and some of the foliage on the left side of the canvas.  The dog standing on the parapet is constructed with brown paper cut in the shape of a dog, and adhered to the paint; the surface of the brown paper is either painted black or is covered with a thin layer of printer's ink.  The parasol is not a paper collage element, but is applied in thick paint.  There is retouching along the entire right edge, but otherwise the paint losses are minimal.  The natural resin varnish has only discolored slightly.",

    "technical_summary": "The painting was executed on a medium-weight, plain-weave fabric that has been lined. Cusping on all four cut edges suggests that the image has not been reduced. The off-white ground is thick and, although seemingly smooth, has a distinctively brushy appearance under x-radiography. Subsequent paint, generally thick, was broadly and rapidly applied. The exceptions are the shadowed areas of the face and hair, which are more thinly executed. It appears that the face, coat, and background were painted directly on the ground, while the hand, book, and chair back were added over the coat and background color. In 1957 the painting was relined and discolored varnish was removed. Two small losses to the right of the sitter's head have been inpainted, as well as smaller losses in the sitter's  right cheek and in the background. His right shoulder has been  reinforced. The varnish has discolored.",

The warm white ground layer is artist-applied and appears to consist of two layers, a smooth thin coat applied overall, followed by a thicker, coarser layer brushed in the central area of the support, in an unusual pattern. Paint was applied simply, with little layering, and with reserves left for all design elements. The face was painted with thin, opaque layers of fluid paint blended  wet-into-wet and with glazes. The slight halo along the contours is the exposed ground layer. The painting has a small loss in the bottom center. Numerous small areas of the face and white shirtfront have been inpainted. The painting was last treated in 1959, when it was lined, discolored varnish was removed, and it was restored. The painting appears to have several layers of varnish, all of which are semi-matte and have not discolored.",

The painting is executed in very thin, fluid washes with linear details.

    "technical_summary": "The canvas is finely plain woven; it was lined in 1971.  The ground is white; it is thickly applied and masks the weave of the canvas.  There appear to be layers of gray and beige imprimatura in some areas.  The painting is executed in freely handled opaque layers ranging from rich, fluid glazes to thick paint; the strongest whites are thickly impasted.  Glazes and scumbles are drawn, scraped, and dragged over the paint layers, and the scumbles of white and light-colored paint that create the luminous effect may be gouache or watercolor.  The details of architecture and rigging are accomplished with very thin fluid paint occasionally reworked by scratching in with a blunt tool.  The thinner paint seems to have been abraded.  There is extensive craquelure.  Retouching is largely limited to the corners and edges, and to the concealment of cracks. There are substantial residues of an earlier natural resin varnish, which has discolored yellow to a significant degree, beneath the dammar varnish applied in 1971.",

    "technical_summary": "The support is a vertically grained white poplar panel, 1.2 cm thick. It was prepared by drawing a sharp, comblike tool diagonally across the board, creating crosshatched lines. The painting has not been cradled. There is no evidence of a ground layer. The paint was generally applied wet-over-dry. Traction crackle in the head and in the waistcoat suggests artist's alterations, and x-radiography shows that the area of the shirt and stock was initially broader and the head was blocked in with off-white paint. A small gouge on the surface of the panel, to the left of the sitter's head, existed  before the painting was completed. The varnish is very dull with scattered saturated, discolored patches.",

    "technical_summary": "The medium-weight canvas is plain woven; it was lined in 1967.  The ground is white; it is very thickly applied and virtually masks the weave of the canvas. The painting is executed very richly with vigorous brushwork and much use of scumbles; the highlights in the water are thickly impasted, and the moon almost stands out in relief.  The sky is painted very thinly and fluidly, probably with some use of watercolor; the rigging on the boats, especially on the left, may also be done in watercolor.  The paint surface seems to be slightly abraded, and some of the highest impasto has been flattened during lining.  There is scattered retouching throughout.  The thick natural resin varnish, which has discolored yellow to a significant degree, was not removed before the dammar varnish was applied in 1967.",

    "technical_summary": "The support is a medium-weight, coarsely textured plain-weave fabric that has been lined. Although the original tacking margins have been removed, there is cusping along all four edges. The mortise-and-tenon panel-back stretcher appears to be original. The continuous ground layer is off-white and of medium thickness. A thin pink imprimatura was applied over the ground in the areas of the sky and water; the land forms and tower were painted directly on the white ground. The paint was built up with rich, slightly blended, flowing strokes that give the painting a distinctly brushy quality with low impasto. Infrared reflectography shows extensive underdrawing defining major compositional elements in several areas. The only area indicating significant changes is along the horizon at the left, where underdrawing shows another island with arched architectural forms; the position of the moon was changed several times. There are no major losses and only scattered areas of small paint loss, particularly in the sky. Some darker areas, especially the foreground hillside and the tower, have drying cracks that were minimized by inpainting in 1993.",

Because of the thickness of the paint it has not been possible to determine the color or composition of the ground.  The painting is executed very freely and fluidly in a low to medium impasto, with thinner glazes and scumbles in a few areas of the sky.  Some diagonal scraping in the underpaint before it had completely dried to create an atmospheric effect, and some palette- knife type application have also been used in parts of the sky.  There is a disfiguring craquelure in the dark layer of underpaint in the foreground and middle ground, probably caused by bitumen.  The paint layer has been somewhat flattened during lining.  There is retouching along all the edges and in the craquelure, but there are no major paint losses and there is no severe abrasion.  The thick, extremely uneven layer of natural resin varnish has discolored yellow to a significant degree.",

There is a fair amount of underdrawing, probably in pencil. Subsequent layers of warm background pigments were applied with swirling, vigorous strokes; the foreground figures and details were constructed with fairly loose brushwork and rich, fluid paint. The painting is in good condition. Discolored varnish was removed in 1978, and minor losses were inpainted.",

The reverse of the panel has a grayish green coating and a sketch of a head. A white ground of medium thickness was applied, with an additional reddish brown toning layer under the head, collar, and background. Paint layers are creamy and smooth and have been applied with a wet-into-wet technique. The surface has been abraded through the face and hair and along the edges; inpainting is evident in these areas. The upper left part of the background has been glazed during a past restoration. A slightly discolored varnish covers the surface.",

    "technical_summary": "The support is composed of two canvases, both of medium weight and plain woven; it has been lined.  There are shallow diagonal grooves cutting across each corner at approximately 14.5 cm.  from the edge; these were scored either in the ground or in the paint layers before the painting was finished.  Although, as confirmed by x-radiographs, the original canvas has always remained square in format, it is clear that Turner did consider an octagonal shape for the design; but it is difficult to know now if the roughly painted corners were meant to be seen or to be covered.  The ground is white, probably calcium carbonate, and thickly applied.  The painting is executed in thick paint, applied with both brush and palette knife, which is covered with thick and thin glaze washes, often blended wet into wet, probably with some use of watercolor, creating the details of the design.  The uppermost paint layers filling the corners outside the grooves are sketchily applied. Some of the impasto has been flattened during lining.  There is one large, old, retouched loss above the tent; otherwise there are only a few scattered losses and little abrasion.  The thick natural resin varnish has discolored yellow to a significant degree.",

The painting is executed with thick white impasto covered with very thin transparent glaze washes of intense colors which create a flickering effect in the highlights.  The glazes have been abraded, or possibly, in the case of the red lakes beneath the city, have faded.  The impasto has been slightly flattened during lining.  There is extensive craquelure which significantly disrupts the composition.  There are a great number of scattered small retouches in the sky and foreground.  The dammar varnish applied in 1971 has discolored yellow slightly.",

The painting is executed in thin, semitransparent layers in the spandrels outside the tondo, more thickly and opaquely in the picture itself, with low impasto in the highlights.  The canvas is dessicated and brittle, and has been damaged by two tears, one in the region of the nostrils of the horse on the left, which has been crudely repaired with wax or putty, and one in the cheek of the horse nearest on the right, which is unrepaired.  The paint surface has been abraded throughout.  The moderately thick natural resin varnish has discolored yellow to a significant degree.",

    "technical_summary": "The painting has been lined and windows have been cut into the lining fabric to reveal inscriptions in ink on the reverse. No cusping is visible along the cut fabric edges. A warm, off-white ground layer of moderate thickness was applied over the plain-weave fabric support. Where original paint is visible, it was applied in short refined brushstrokes, with fine applications of thin paint used to indicate the texture of the animals' fur. However, a great deal of the surface is covered with overpaint. Many of the grass stalks are inventions of a restorer, and the sky and back of the weasel on the left are almost completely overpainted. Beneath the overpaint are numerous unfilled losses in the original paint. A large vertical tear, one-third of the way in from the left edge, runs almost from top to bottom. The painting's condition is extremely poor. The thick varnish has become somewhat discolored.",

    "technical_summary": "The finely woven, plain-weave support has been lined. Cusping along all four cut edges suggests that the image has not been reduced. The white ground is thick and smooth, and subsequent paint was applied rapidly and thickly, except in the dark dress and shadowed areas, where the paint is thinner. X-radiography indicates several changes: in the profile of the bonnet, in the right sleeve, and in the upper portion of the dress where the bonnet's ties have been covered by dark paint. In 1952 the painting was relined, discolored varnish was removed, and the painting was restored. There is some minor inpainting around the sitter's left eye, on her right shoulder, on her neck, and along the bottom edge. A pervasive system of thin, branched cracks runs through the paint film. The glossy varnish has become discolored.",

The ground layer shows through the foreground, creating a luminosity in some of the browns. Fine brushstrokes of thinly applied paint are used to suggest the texture of the fox's fur. The sky is more thickly painted, wet-into-wet. White highlights in impasted paint outline most of the design areas. The condition of the painting is reasonably good, with the exception of the edges. There is a tear in the back of the fox and a dime-size loss in the center of the sky. Blistering and crizzled paint and long, irregular losses along the bottom edge are the result of water damage. The varnish is unevenly glossy and has become highly discolored.",

The sky was painted more thickly, with low impasto blended wet-into-wet. The bull was added last in heavier, wet-into-wet paint. Pentimenti are evident in the tree on the left side and in the change of the position of the foreground path. Inpainting covers a number of relatively large losses, the biggest of which is found in the sky to the right of the trees. There is a tear inside the left stretcher bar. In 1989 the painting was relined and a new varnish coating was applied over remnants of an old, discolored varnish layer.",

Flesh tones are blended with a minimum of impasto, while the garments are painted thickly and opaquely. In the olive background, an appearance of a slight, swirling texture was created by a thin layer of glazing laid down over more thickly applied paint. Small losses and areas of inpainting occur in the sitter's hair, at his hairline, and on his coat. A tiny cut or puncture is evident in the upper left part of the background. The evenly applied varnish is heavy and has discolored.",

A thin white ground layer was apparently applied while the fabric was on a different stretcher, because the ground only covers parts of the tacking margins. Underdrawing in a dry medium is visible in normal light in several areas, some of which show changes. The blue flag flying from the large ship at the center right was originally slightly lower on the mast; several flags were underdrawn on the smaller ship at the right, but not subsequently painted. The riggings of the various vessels have imprecise underdrawing, but the painted lines were possibly executed with the aid of a straight edge. Some of the waves also have underdrawing. The paint layers were applied very thinly, with a low impasto, to create highlights in the waves. The paint surface is in very good condition, with no evidence of significant losses or abrasion. The varnish has not discolored.",

The ground is a thin, even, grayish white layer with a transparent, reddish brown imprimatura layer that is visible through some of the more thinly painted passages, as in the hair. The paint was applied with moderately thick blended brushstrokes in the flesh areas and the vest of the sitter, and in fairly thin, random brushstrokes in the coat and background. There are minor areas of inpainting in the hair and the left cheek of the sitter, and a toned varnish over the sitter's face and vest. The varnish is slightly yellowed.",

    "technical_summary": "The support is a medium-weight, plain-weave fabric. The painting has been lined and the original tacking margins have been removed, but cusping  exists on the right edge. The white, textured ground layer, applied evenly across the surface of the canvas, is rather thick in comparison to the paint. Infrared reflectography indicates what may be chalk or charcoal underdrawing or possibly underpainting executed in very dry paint. Two linear depressions along the trunk of the central tree are visible through x-radiography, suggesting that the artist scratched an initial compositional detail into the wet ground. Indications of changes and alterations  occur throughout the paint layer, particularly in the tree branches along the top edge. Inpainting is found only along one crack at the right edge of the painting. The varnish has not discolored.",
