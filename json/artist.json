    "biography": "Donato Creti was born in Cremona in 1671, the son of Giuseppe Creti (1634-1714), an undistinguished Bolognese quadratura painter. After the family's return to Bologna, Donato's natural talents came to light and he soon entered the studio of the local painter Giorgio Raparini (1660-1725).  While learning only the rudiments of the painter's art from Raparini, he spent his time drawing after prints by Guido Reni (1575-1642) and Simone Cantarini (1612-1648).The young Creti's precocious talent did not go unnoticed, and at the urging of an associate of his father's he moved to the studio of Lorenzo Pasinelli (1629-1700), then the preeminent painter in Bologna.  It is unclear how long he spent with Pasinelli before entering the household of his first patron, Count Alessandro Fava. Around 1700 he made his only trip outside Bologna, traveling to Venice in the company of the younger Fava, Pietro Ercole, a colleague from Pasinelli's life drawing classes.  Here Creti gained firsthand experience of the Venetian painters who had been and would continue to be so important in his development, particularly Veronese (1528-1588) and Titian (1488-1576).Creti began painting at the very young age of 15, and after an initial, as yet sparsely documented, period to about 1700, he settled into a mature style that changed little over the course of his life.  This style derives principally from that of his teacher Pasinelli, a student of Simone Cantarini, who was, in turn, a student of Guido Reni.  Creti is thus linked directly to the classical, Renian current in the Bolognese school by both temperament and training.  According to his friend and biographer Anton Maria Zanotti, Creti was an obsessive perfectionist who took particular pains over the poses, expressions and draperies of individual figures.  A similarly meticulous attention to detail is seen in his small, neat brushstrokes and his highly finished surfaces.  His flesh tones are smooth and porcelain-like, and his bold colors have a deep, almost metallic brilliance, for, as Zanotti recounted, Creti shunned the dark varnishes used by other painters to imitate the patina that builds up naturally over time.Creti's initial output was destined primarily for the collection of his principal patrons, Alessandro Fava and his son Pietro Ercole. From the first years of the eighteenth century he was mainly engaged in executing easel paintings for Bolognese nobles, as well as for Roman cardinals and foreign collectors.  These paintings are primarily of mythological or pastoral subjects, generally consisting of a few graceful figures carefully disposed in idyllic landscape settings.  In the latter part of his career, from c. 1730 on, he executed a number of large altarpieces for churches in Bologna and also sent many to nearby cities.  In creating these religious works, he continued to look to Guido and the earlier Bolognese masters, drawing on them for compositional schemas and individual figures.Along with Zanotti, Creti was active in the founding and subsequent activities of the Accademia Clementina in Bologna, but, perhaps due to his difficult personality, he had few students of his own.  In any event, he had little impact on the development of the Bolognese school, which looked increasingly to outside, particularly Venetian, influences in the later eighteenth century.  Creti died in Bologna in 1749.  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "Nicolas de Largillierre, one of Europe's premier painters of portraits, history paintings, and still lifes during the late seventeenth century and the first four decades of the eighteenth, was born in Paris in 1656. He was the son of a hatmaker and merchant who moved with his family to Antwerp in 1659. As a boy of nine, he traveled for the first time to London in the company of an associate of his father. After returning to Antwerp more than a year later, his artistic gifts were recognized and his father apprenticed him to Antoni Goubau (1616-1698), a painter of bambocciate, genre scenes, and landscapes. Something of a prodigy, he was admitted to the painters' Guild of Saint Luke when he was only seventeen. In 1675 he made a second trip to London, where he was employed at Windsor Castle (possibly at the suggestion of Peter Lely [1618-1680]) and worked as a restorer under the direction of Italian painter and decorator Antonio Verrio (c. 1639-1707), who brought him to the attention of King Charles II (r. 1660-1685).      At this time Largillierre painted a number of still life paintings in the manner of such Dutch and Flemish masters as Wilhelm Seghers, Jan Davidz. De Heem (1606-c. 1683), and Rachel Ruysch (1664-1750). Thereafter he practiced this branch of painting with consummate skill, a talent that allowed him to make brilliant use of flowers, fruit, and animals in some of his most ambitious portraits and contemporary history pictures. When repressive anti-Catholic legislation was enacted by the British Parliament in 1678, Largillierre and other of Verrio's assistants may have been exempted from persecution.      In 1679 Largillierre settled in Paris, where he specialized in baroque portraiture in the grand manner of Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640), Anthony van Dyck (1599-1641), and Peter Lely (1618-1680). The Flemish battle painter Adam Frans van der Meulen (1631 or 1632-1690) introduced him to Charles Le Brun (1619-1690) who, as First Painter to King Louis XIV (r. 1643-1715) and director of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture, was the predominant figure in France's official art establishment. Upon his acceptance as a candidate for admission to the Académie, he agreed to execute as his diploma picture a large portrait of Le Brun (completed 1686, Paris, Musée du Louvre) seated in his studio surrounded by the accoutrements of his art and an oil study for The Second Conquest of Franche-Comté, one of the large decorations for the ceiling of Galerie des Glaces at Versailles. In 1686, Largillierre made a final, brief trip to England, where he painted portraits of the newly crowned king, James II (r. 1685-1688) (Greenwich, National Maritime Museum) and his consort Mary of Modena (1658-1718). After the Glorious Revolution, James fell from power, fled to France, and took up residence near Paris at the old Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. For many years thereafter, Largillierre was employed as one of the principal portraitists of the Jacobite court.      Between 1689 and 1722, the artist was commissioned to paint a number of events commemorating civic ceremonies in honor of royalty sponsored by the provosts and aldermen of the city of Paris: Louis XIV visiting the Hôtel de Ville following an illness in 1687, the marriage of the duc de Bourgogne and Princess Maria Adelaide of Savoy in 1697, the accession of the duc d'Anjou to the throne of Spain in 1700, and the arrival in Paris of the Infanta Mariana Victoria of Spain in 1722. He also executed an ex-voto honoring the patron of Paris, Saint Genevieve, interceding to put an end to a famine in 1694 (Paris, Église de Saint-Étienne-du-Mont). These large paintings, all but one of them destroyed, combined portraiture and allegory, and their monumentality elevated them to the status of history paintings.      In 1699, Largillierre married Marguerite Élisabeth Forest, and the couple had three children. That year he exhibited thirteen paintings at the Salon, all but one of them portraits. In 1704 he showed a considerable number of works in the Louvre, including the bold portrait of his father-in-law, the landscape painter Jean Baptiste Forest (c. 1634-1712) (Lille, Musée des Beaux-Arts). He continued to produce moving religious paintings and still lifes (vanitas pictures and decorative overdoors depicting flowers and fruit), but he acquired his enormous reputation primarily as a portraitist. In contrast to his contemporary Hyacinthe Rigaud (1659-1743), however, he was seldom patronized by the court of Versailles, and much of his clientele was made up of government officials, members of the high clergy, municipal leadership, and judiciary, the Parisian and provincial aristocracy, the wealthiest echelons of the middle class, artists, and foreign dignitaries.      In Largillierre's portraiture, subjects are elegantly integrated into indoor or outdoor settings, and the artist often relies on mythological disguises, flurries of drapery, and flamboyant poses to dramatize his characterizations of them. Much of the beauty of his painting resides in a daring exploitation of the resonant colors of his palette, for Largillierre belonged to that group of painters and theorists led by Roger de Piles (1635-1709) who championed the notion that the sensual appeal of color was equal in importance to the more intellectual emphasis on line and design in the creative act of painting. In his celebrated Belle Strasbourgeoise of 1703 (Strasbourg, Musée des Beaux-Arts), the subject of which has never been positively identified, the woman's pearlescent flesh tones and pink lips are set off by the intense blacks of her picturesque beribboned dress and bicorner hat. Largillierre's powerful depictions of René Frémin of c. 1710-1712 (Berlin, Gemäldegalerie) and Crown Prince Friedrich Augustus of Saxony of 1714-1715 (Melbourne, National Gallery of Victoria) illustrate in the one case the poise and confidence of a master sculptor at work in his studio and the martial aplomb of a military leader and future head of state.      Late in his career, Largillierre's portraits became more intimate and relaxed. In his half-lengths, he concentrates on the character and psychology of his models, presenting them in static poses before minimal backgrounds that announce the work of his successors Louis Tocqué (1696-1792) and Maurice Quentin de La Tour (1704-1788). His informal portrait of the young Voltaire of 1718 (Paris, private collection) and the 1734 likeness of the comte de Richebourg-le-Toureil (Cleveland Museum of Art) exemplify a less ostentatious type of representation. And his double portrait of the silversmith Thomas Germain and his wife (Lisbon, Museu Calouste Gulbenkian), painted in 1736, demonstrates that the eighty-year-old painter had lost none of his technical virtuosity or his mastery of color combinations and compositional difficulties.      Although Largillierre is known to have produced oil sketches of sitters' faces and hands and studies for his contemporary history pictures, he painted his portraits quickly and directly onto canvas with little or no preparation, relying on scumbles and transparent glazes to achieve the rich and sonorous effects he sought. His enormous output--some 1,500 portraits that are currently being catalogued by Dominique Brême--required him to maintain a workshop manned with studio assistants to whom he delegated the painting of costumes and minor accessories. In the course of his long career he amassed a large fortune and lived on a grand scale. The venerable artist, who had trained Jean Baptiste Oudry (1686-1755) and was prescient enough to appreciate the genius of Jean Siméon Chardin (1699-1779), died in 1746 at the age of ninety, having served terms as professor, rector, chancellor, and director of the Académie royale.      Very few museums can claim to possess examples of Nicolas de Largillierre's work of such supreme quality as those of the National Gallery of Art. The three portraits by him in its French rooms chronologically span a good portion of his long career, and each in its own right is a masterpiece. The relatively early Portrait of a Young Man and His Tutor (NGA 1961.9.26) was executed at approximately the time the artist applied for membership in the Académie. What is undoubtedly his finest Self-Portrait (NGA 2006.26.1) dates from his full maturity, when he was at the top of his form. Finally, the wonderfully sensitive depiction of Elizabeth Throckmorton (NGA 1964.20.1) is a work executed when the painter was over seventy years old.[Joseph Baillio, in French Paintings of the Fifteenth through the Eighteenth Century, Washington, D.C., 2009: 292-293.]",

    "biography": "Sebastiano Ricci was born in Belluno in 1659.  At the age of fourteen, Sebastiano Ricci left his birthplace for Venice, where he soon entered the studio of Federico Cervelli (c. 1625 - before 1700), a Milanese painter active there since the mid-1650s.  While contemporary biographers sometimes discounted Sebastiano's debt to Cervelli, modern scholars generally agree that the Milanese master gave him solid practical instruction and introduced him to the Venetian painters of the seventeenth century.Prompted by the first of several well documented romantic misadventures, Sebastiano's departure for Bologna in the summer of 1681 initiated a fifteen-year period of intense study and work in Emilia, Lombardy, and Rome.  While moving about in the pursuit of love or refuge from the law, Sebastiano availed himself of the opportunity to study the works of earlier masters and to seek commissions in which to apply and refine the lessons learned from them.  In Bologna he gravitated toward the studio of Carlo Cignani (1628-1719), then the leading exponent of the Carracci tradition. In Parma he studied the sensuous color of Correggio (1495-1534) and Parmigianino (1503-1540), as well as their graceful, refined figure repertory.  Supported by one of his most important Emilian patrons, Ranuccio II Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza, Sebastiano went to Rome in 1691.  Here he studied works of the great seicento decorators, the Carracci, Pietro da Cortona (1596-1669), Giovanni Lanfranco (1582-1647), Andrea Pozzo (1642-1709), and Luca Giordano (1634-1705), refining his own skills as a decorator, colorist, and manipulator of light effects.The importance of Alessandro Magnasco (1667-1749) in Sebastiano's development remains a point of scholarly disagreement.  Initial contact between Sebastiano and the younger Genoese artist may have occured as early as c. 1694 or perhaps later in Milan.  Sebastiano's nephew Marco Ricci (1676-1729) is known to have worked with Magnasco and thus may have been a point of contact.In 1696 Sebastiano returned for a brief period to Venice.  While at work on numerous commissions, he resumed his study of the sixteenth-century Venetian masters, particularly Veronese.  From this point onward, Sebastiano's works reveal careful exploration of Veronese's pure color and tonal highlights, expressive use of light, compositional schemas, and richness of costume, and the assimilation of these lessons into an already mature personal style formed during earlier years of travel.After 1700, Sebastiano's fame was such that he was summoned to execute commissions in Vienna and in Florence.  In 1713 he accompanied his nephew Marco to England, where he executed a number of major commissions, some in close collaboration with Marco.  On the return trip to Venice in 1716, Sebastiano stopped in Paris, where he was accepted into the Académie Royale de Peinture.  Back in Venice, the collaboration between Sebastiano as figure painter and Marco as specialist in architectural and landscape backgrounds continued and intensified during the 1720s.  Sebastiano remained in Venice until his death in 1734 and never lacked for commissions from Venetian patrons or from such important foreign rulers as the Duke of Savoy and the Emperor Charles VI.

    "biography": "Jean Antoine Watteau came from a modest family in the Flemish city of Valenciennes, now in northern France. He is said to have spent his formative years training under either the religious painter Jacques Albert Gérin (c. 1640-1702) or the sculptor Antoine Joseph Pater (1670-1747), the father of his only pupil, Jean Baptiste Pater (1695-1736). In 1702 Watteau arrived in Paris, first finding employment with a picture dealer on the Pont Notre-Dame specializing in the rote production of portraits and religious paintings. Around 1705 he entered the studio of Claude Gillot (1673-1722), a draftsman, printmaker, and painter. Gillot was an influential, idiosyncratic master who transmitted to Watteau a degree of the satirical whimsy that characterized his own specialized depictions of theater and genre scenes, bacchanals, and decoration designs. Watteau also absorbed from Gillot the formal and technical elements that made up his own style: an energetic, assured draftsmanship, sinewy figures, and a penchant for expressive themes and characters. By 1708 Watteau entered the workshop of the ornamental painter Claude Audran III (1658-1734), helping him create interior decoration for private and royal residences.      In 1709 Watteau received second prize in the yearly competition of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture for the Prix de Rome for his submission Abigail Who Brings Food to David (location unknown). Disenchanted by this setback and the conditions of his employment with Audran, Watteau returned to Valenciennes, having financed his trip home by selling his painting Return from the Campaign (location unknown) to the dealer Pierre Sirois for 60 livres. As a garrison town, Valenciennes provided the inspiration for distinctive military scenes characterized by an attention to the quotidian aspects of camp life, a genre that Watteau gainfully exploited after his return to Paris some time in 1710. Watteau also applied his ineffable draftsmanship to printmaking, producing an album of fashion plate etchings, Figures de modes, from about 1709 to 1713. Such a production reflected Watteau's awareness of and reliance on the prevailing tastes of elite private clients, a class of patrons epitomized by Pierre Crozat (1665-1740), the immensely wealthy banker to the French monarch. Crozat soon became Watteau's most important and devoted patron. Watteau lived for a time in Crozat's Parisian hôtel particulier, where he not only painted a set of important decorations of the seasons, including the National Gallery of Art's Ceres (Summer) (1961.9.50), but also made drawn copies after important Italian master paintings and drawings from Crozat's vast collection. Through Crozat, Watteau became intimately engaged with Venetian painting, a tradition much in vogue in France during the regency period.     In spite of a production largely outside the mainstream of academic art, Watteau remained within the orbit of the Académie. In 1712 he was approved (agréé) by the Académie, owing to the favorable evaluation given to his picture Les Jaloux. This painting, known only through an engraving, depicted commedia dell'arte figures commingling in a forest clearing, a fusion of landscape and costumed characters that exemplified Watteau's hybrid pictorial style. The peculiarity of Watteau's productions in turn led the Académie to break long-established tradition by allowing the artist to choose the subject of his morceau de reception, the painting required for full admittance to the Académie. Five years elapsed before Watteau submitted as his reception piece on August 28, 1717, the famous Pilgrimage to Cythera (Paris, Musée du Louvre), a picture that is the exemplar of Watteau's newly invented genre of the fête galante. As depictions of elegant figures in park settings engaged in amorous interaction, fêtes galantes harnessed an array of artistic precedents and contemporary cultural tendencies: garden scenes with figures by earlier masters such as Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640), Venetian color, and the incipient libertinism of the regency period. Yet Watteau far exceeded the sum of this composite lineage, using indefinite locales and the suggestive psychology of his figures to imbue his fêtes galantes with a mysterious potency. Such was the fête galante's alluring novelty that the Académie made an exception in establishing it as a new category in which to receive Watteau as a full member.      But Watteau soon distanced himself from the Académie, finding his patrons among a small circle of private admirers rather than in the official world of the state and the church. It may have been to seek further commercial success that in 1720 Watteau traveled to London, where he hoped to find another audience for his talents. By this time he was suffering from what is believed to have been tuberculosis, and it is possible that he also intended to consult with the infectious disease specialist Dr. Richard Mead, for whom he painted several important pictures, including the National Gallery of Art's The Italian Comedians (1946.7.9). On his return to Paris in 1721, Watteau resided for a time with the dealer Edme François Gersaint, painting the famous Shop Sign (Berlin, Charlottenburg Palace) for the latter's premises. Eventually moving out on his own to Nogent-sur-Marne, Watteau briefly renewed his friendship with his former student Jean Baptiste Pater, whom he instructed during his last months of life. Watteau died at the age of thirty-seven in 1721.[Benedict Leca, in French Painting of the Fifteenth through the Eighteenth Century, The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue, Washington, D.C., 2009: 465.]",

    "biography": "Born in Paris on March 17, 1686, Jean-Baptiste Oudry was the son of a minor painter and art dealer, Jacques Oudry (c. 1661-1720), and his wife, née Nicole Papillon. In 1706 his father was made director of the Académie de Saint-Luc, the old painters' guild that was the only serious competition to the more prestigious and influential Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture. Jacques Oudry taught his son the technical aspects of his art, and the youth attended drawing courses at the Académie de Saint-Luc and the Académie royale. In 1704 he received some training from Michel Serre (1658-1733), a cousin of the portraitist Hyacinthe Rigaud (1659-1743).      In 1707, Oudry began a five-year apprenticeship with Rigaud's main competitor, Nicolas de Largillierre (1656-1746), under whose direction he copied works of the Flemish and Dutch schools of the seventeenth century. With Largillierre he refined his sense of color and his remarkable skills as a painter of still life and portraiture, both subject types in which his master had deservedly achieved enormous fame. In 1708, after completing as his reception piece a now-lost religious composition depicting Saint Jerome, Oudry was inducted into the Académie de Saint-Luc. Other religious paintings followed, as well as a long series of portraits, many of which were recorded in the drawings of his early two-volume Livre de raison (Département des Arts Graphiques, Musée du Louvre). In 1710, Oudry married Marie Marguerite Froissé, by whom he would have many children, including a son, Jacques Charles (1722/1723-1778), who also became a painter.      In 1719 Oudry was elected to membership in the Académie royale. From the start of his career, he was attracted to the painting of flora and fauna in the manner of the Dutch animalier painters Frans Snyders (1579-1657), Jan Fyt (1611-1661), Jan Baptist Weenix (1621-1660/1661), Melchior d'Hondecoeter (1636-1695), and Abraham Hondius (c. 1625-1691), and he soon became a congenial rival to the older Alexandre François Desportes (1661-1743), who specialized in the same genres. He proved his mettle in such sumptuous performances as the decorative series of the Four Elements (Stockholm, Nationalmuseum) of 1719-1721 and the pendants Dead Wolf and Dead Roe (London, Wallace Collection) of 1721. These masterpieces were followed by several large hunt pictures, the most notable of which are the Wolf Hunt (Ansbach, Ansbach Residenz) and the Stag Hunt (Stockholm, Royal Palace). As the Académie royale held no exhibitions between 1704 and 1737, for a time Oudry showed his works at the only public venue available to him, the Exposition de la jeunesse, which was held on the Place Dauphine on the feast of Corpus Christi.      The greatest boost to Oudry's official career was provided by his patron, Henri Camille, the chevalier de Beringhen (NGA 1994.14.1), who introduced the painter to the young Louis XV, and he was soon made painter in ordinary of the royal hunts and granted a studio and lodgings for himself and his family in the Tuileries palace. In 1728 the royal arts administration commissioned him to paint a huge canvas representing Louis XV Hunting Deer in the Forest of Saint-Germain (originally hung in the main pavilion at Marly and today in the Musée des Augustins, Toulouse), which he completed in 1730. He depicts himself in the lower right corner of this composition, the first of his celebrations of the chasse à courre, the king's favorite physical activity. For the Château de Compiègne, the artist executed a series of overdoor \"portraits\" of royal hunting dogs (an example is Misse and Luttine, NGA 1994.53.1). Switching registers, he painted commedia dell'arte subjects, arabesque decorations in the manner of Jean Antoine Watteau (1684-1721), and views of model farms that hark back to the bucolic landscapes of Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640).      Oudry's favor at court was such that in March 1726 he exhibited the contents of his studio in the Grands Appartements at Versailles. That year another of his patrons, the finance minister Louis Fagon (1680-1744), obtained for him the position of painter to the Beauvais tapestry works, whose director he became in 1734. During his tenure he completely overhauled the administration of the manufactory, imposing strict technical standards on the weavers, whom he compelled to adhere more strictly to the painted cartoons. In a stroke of genius he hired François Boucher (1703-1770) as principal designer at Beauvais. Oudry himself provided cartoons for several series of wall hangings, among them The New Hunts, Country Pleasures, The Comedies of Molière, and The Fables of La Fontaine. In 1733 he began designing for the Gobelins tapestry factory one of eighteenth-century France's greatest masterpieces of the decorative arts, the nine-panel series of the Royal Hunts (modelli in the Musée Camondo, Paris, and full-size painted cartoons in the Musée de Fontainebleau and the Musée du Louvre), which were woven only twice (Musées des domaines nationaux de Compiègne and Florence, Palazzo Pitti). As a reward the artist was appointed inspector of the Gobelins in 1748.      Oudry was made associate professor in the Académie royale in 1739 and full professor in 1743. From 1737 until 1753 he was a regular exhibitor at the Salon in the Palais du Louvre, where he and his family were provided lodgings in 1744. He could count among his international clientele the Margrave of Ansbach, Grand Duke Friedrich of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1717-1785), and Sweden's ambassador to the court of France, Count Carl Gustaf Tessin (1695-1770). To these patrons he sold some of the most important paintings he had retained in his studio, and for them he executed still lifes, game pieces, hunt scenes, depictions of exotic animals, and rural landscapes. Among the masterpieces of the artist's mature period are Mallards Attacked by a Bird of Prey (Schwerin, Staatliches Museum) of 1740, the Dead Crane (Schwerin, Staatliches Museum) of 1745, The Farm (Paris, Musée du Louvre) of 1750, Bitch Hound Nursing Her Pups (Paris, Musée de la Chasse et de la Nature) of 1752, and the best known of his trompe l'oeil still lifes, The White Duck (collection of the Marquess of Cholmondeley, Houghton Hall, Norfolk; reported stolen in 1992) of 1753. The latter is a stylistic exercise in which the description of the textures and surfaces of the objects is a breathtaking tour de force.      A consummate draftsman, Oudry executed a considerable body of highly finished presentation drawings and preparatory sketches, many of them the result of his direct observation of nature. Between 1725 and 1735 he produced illustrations for two literary masterpieces of the reign of Louis XIV, Le Roman Comique by Paul Scarron (1610-1660) and Les Fables of Jean de La Fontaine (1621-1695); a number of these are in the National Gallery of Art. He also drew many landscape studies, the best of which depict views of the abandoned park and gardens of the prince de Guise's estate at Arcueil.      Jean Baptiste Oudry died at Beauvais on April 30, 1755, after experiencing several apoplectic strokes.[Joseph Baillio, in French Paintings of the Fifteenth through the Eighteenth Century, The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue, Washington, D.C., 2009: 350-351.]",

    "biography": "Born in Venice in 1696 to a prosperous merchant, Giovanni Battista (Giambattista) Tiepolo chose to pursue a career in painting.  He was taught by Gregorio Lazzarini (1655-1730), studying under him probably c. 1710.  In 1717 he was inscribed in the Venetian painters guild as an independent painter.  His earliest dateable works, in the Ospedaletto, Venice (1715-1716), do not display the classical compositions and smooth finish characteristic of Lazzarini's paintings, but rather the avant-garde tenebrism of Federico Bencovich (1677-1726) and Giovanni Battista Piazzetta (1683-1754).  Much controversy surrounds the course of Tiepolo's development in the next fifteen years in which there are few dated paintings.  Knowledge of his activities in the teens and twenties comes mostly from Vincenzo da Canal's biography of Lazzarini (1732), in which the author devoted several pages to the talented pupil whose popularity had soared in the previous decade.  During these early years Tiepolo experimented with various styles simultaneously, and recent scholarship based on da Canal's listing of Tiepolo's paintings prior to 1732 has shown that the artist vacillated between the tenebrism practiced by many Venetian contemporaries and a lighter, more atmospheric style.  As early as c. 1716 Tiepolo was practicing the art of fresco painting on the terrafirma, a technique reintroduced into the Veneto in the late sixteenth century by non-Venetian artists.  His grandest decorative cycle of the period, painted for the Archbishop's Palace in Udine (c. 1726-1729), reveals his interest in Veronese's color and compositions.Tiepolo's frescoes in Udine brought him immediate fame and commissions for further decorative ensembles.  In the next ten years he painted and frescoed in palaces and villas in and around Milan, Bergamo, Venice, and and elsewhere in the Veneto, the subjects of which derive mostly from ancient history.  With the Bolognese quadrattura painter Girolamo Mengozzi-Colonna (c. 1688-c. 1766), who designed his architectural surrounds, Tiepolo revolutionized the art of fresco decoration in Venice by combining the deep perspective of Venetian cinquecento ceiling decorations with a compositional clarity that connected the diverse elements of the design into a greatly expanded pictorial space.  Unlike their direct precedents in which forms were arranged haphazardly across the ceiling, Tiepolo's compositions are ordered in zig-zag patterns that expand the illusionistic view into the heavens.  By 1740, after conquering towering church ceilings such as the Gesuati, Venice (1737-1739), with this method, he brought figures closer to the spectator in long, low secular rooms by distributing his deeply colored figures along the cornice and contrasting them with increasingly lighter pastel hues in the open skies (Palazzo Clerici, Milan, 1740).  In the same years Tiepolo developed as an artist of religious altarpieces, in which he captured counter-reformatory devotional images in a neo-Renaissance format.Tiepolo's fame and prices increased further in the 1740s.  He moved several times during his career, always to grander quarters, which he shared with his wife Cecilia, the sister of Francesco Guardi and their nine children.  The artist had already rejected an invitation to Sweden in 1736, and now his paintings were being requested in northern Europe.  His friendship with Francesco Algarotti (1712-1764), whom he met in 1743, brought him commissions from the Saxon court of Dresden.  Although always inspired by ancient history, in this period Tiepolo turned increasingly to representations of antique monuments and dress.  At the same time, he took up etching, producing two sets of prints--the Scherzi di fantasia and the Capricci--both heavily laden with antique references.External political forces kept foreigners from Venice in the second half of the 1740s, causing an economic slowdown in the city and compelling Venetian artists to seek employment abroad.  Although Tiepolo was so active in this decade that he enlisted the help of his son Giovanni Domenico (Giandomenico, 1723-1804), he nevertheless accepted the lucrative invitation to work for Prince Bishop Carl Philipp von Greiffenklau of Würzburg in the archiepiscopal palace, where he resided from late 1750 to 1753. There he produced what is considered his greatest triumph, the enormous ceiling fresco in the grand staircase with Olympus and the Four Continents (1752-53).  Another son, Lorenzo (1736-1777), less talented than Giandomenico, also accompanied his father to Würzburg as a helper.In the 1740s and 1750s, Tiepolo's expanded repertoire included literary, historical, mythological, allegorical, as well as religious works.  He continued to produce masterpieces in both Venice and the Veneto, such as the story of Antony and Cleopatra in the Palazzo Labia, Venice (1746-1747), and the scenes from Tasso in the Villa Valmarana, Vicenza (1757).  Commissions from abroad continued: Tiepolo sent works to the kings of France and England and the czarina of Russia.  In 1761, King Charles III of Spain requested Tiepolo's services to paint in the newly completed Royal Palace in Madrid.  Due to political pressures and in spite of his age and illness from the gout, Tiepolo set off on his last journey in 1762.  Although his large ceiling fresco for the Throne Room in the Royal Palace, Madrid (1762-1764) has been criticized as a reworking of earlier compositions, its breadth and sophistication mark it as one of his late successes.  His altarpieces for San Juan Baylon at Aranjuez (1767-1769) reveal an old age style of simply presented but deep religious meditation and emotion.About the time of Tiepolo's death in Madrid in 1770, the taste for dramatic allegorical subjects and passionate religious themes had faded throughout Europe in favor of a severe neo-classical style that reflected the new rationalism of the period.  By the end of the century, with the fall of monarchic power and lessening influence of religious institutions, Tiepolo's art was outdated.  Even his son Giandomenico had taken up more objectively motivated themes and a realistic style.  In spite of this, Tiepolo is recognized today as one of the most brilliant and celebrated artists of the eighteenth century and the last of the great practitioners of the Renaissance and baroque tradition.

    "biography": "Jean Siméon Chardin (often in his lifetime also called Jean Baptiste Siméon Chardin)[1] was born in Paris in 1699 and spent his entire life there. Such a parochial existence was unusual for an artist of Chardin's critical, official, and international reputation. His life was essentially uneventful, if such a statement is appropriate to a man who produced some of the greatest works of art in the eighteenth century. He learned what he needed from the old masters he saw in the French royal collection, in the collections of Parisian amateurs, or passing through the active Parisian art market of the day. He might have claimed he did not need to visit Rome or the Netherlands. Like many artists at the time, Chardin was born into the artisan class (his father manufactured billiard tables), which introduced him into the world of luxury goods, professional decorators, and the fine arts. At about the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to the history painter Pierre Jacques Cazes (1676-1754), soon moving to the studio of Noël Nicolas Coypel (1690-1734). But the elevated path of history painting was not for him. About 1720 he painted a large pictorial signboard (destroyed) for the premises of a surgeon, and his first genre scenes on a modest scale, including The Game of Billiards (Paris, Musée Carnavalet). In 1724 he was received into the Académie de Saint Luc, the painters' guild, and in 1728 he exhibited several works, including The Ray of 1725-1726 and The Buffet of 1728 (both Paris, Musée du Louvre) in the annual Exposition de la jeunesse in the Place Dauphine. These works brought him sufficient attention and acclaim that he was that same year received into the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture as a painter \"of animals and fruits\": the two celebrated still lifes were his reception pieces. He continued to exhibit at the Exposition de la jeunesse until the Académie established regular exhibitions, exclusive to its own members, in 1737. Until about 1733 Chardin's main production was of still life subjects, but in that year he turned seriously to genre scenes, painting the monumental Woman Sealing a Letter (Berlin, Schloss Charlottenburg), dated 1733, and the smaller Woman at a Water Cistern (Stockholm, Nationalmuseum), dated 1733 (or possibly 1735). At the Salon of 1737 Chardin exhibited seven small genre scenes, establishing his mastery in this domain and attracting critical acclaim. A staunch supporter and committee member of the Académie, he exhibited still lifes and genre subjects at every Salon until 1779, the year of his death. From 1755 to 1774 he was treasurer of the academy. From 1761 to 1774 he was tapissier of the Salon, meaning that he supervised the installation of the works in the exhibition.   In 1738 an engraving was published after one of the genre scenes--Woman Sealing a Letter--which was to become a regular practice, augmenting Chardin's income through the sale of multiple impressions and disseminating his genre imagery far beyond the Paris Salon and the private walls of his collectors. His art, especially his genre paintings, were sought by bourgeois, aristocratic, and royal collectors across Europe, from Paris to Stockholm, from Edinburgh to St. Petersburg, from Vienna to Karlsruhe. Chardin's laborious method of working, but also the success of certain designs, encouraged him to paint more than one and often several versions of many of his genre and still life subjects. The lowly character of his subject matter and his bold, impastoed manner of painting ran counter to the prevalent rococo trend that dominated the Parisian art world in the early part of his career and to the academic classicism that developed during his last two decades. Yet Chardin remained admired and sought after until the end, in spite of a certain disdain expressed by more academically minded critics. Problems with his eyesight in the last few years led him to adopt pastel painting, in which he made brilliant portraits, especially of his wife and himself.[1] For a discussion of Chardin's names, see Pierre Rosenberg, in Chardin, 1699-1779, Exh. cat.; Galeries nationales du Grand Palais, Paris; Cleveland Museum of Art; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Cleveland, 1979: 382.[Philip Conisbee, in French Paintings of the Fifteenth through the Eighteenth Century, The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue, Washington, D.C., 2009: 58.]",

    "biography": "Hogarth was born in Bartholomew Close, near Smithfield Market, London, on 19 November 1697, the eldest surviving of the nine children of Richard Hogarth and Anne Gibbons.  His father opened a coffeehouse when William was five, but it failed and his father was confined for debt.  Hogarth lived with his family, from 1708 to 1712, within the jurisdiction of the Fleet prison, an experience he never forgot.  Unable to aspire to anything higher, he was apprenticed in 1713 or 1714 to Ellis Gamble, a silver engraver. In 1720 he set up on his own as a print engraver, operating from home, and was an original subscriber to the academy of St. Martin's Lane founded by Louis Chéron and John Vanderbank.Hogarth published his first satirical print in 1721, and his first major series in 1726.  He began painting in about 1726 and achieved a rapid success, executing small genre and comic scenes, several versions of an episode from The Beggar's Opera, and conversation pieces, some with interior and others with outdoor settings.  In 1729 he eloped with Jane Thornhill, the daughter of the eminent history painter Sir James Thornhill.  The couple, forgiven, were allowed to move into Thornhill's house in the Great Piazza, Covent Garden, in 1731, but two years later they moved to Golden Head, Leicester Fields, where Hogarth remained for the rest of his life.In 1730 Hogarth painted his first series of \"modern moral Subject[s],\" launching a subscription for engravings the following year; he was characteristically original in dispensing with both engraver and printseller, performing these functions himself.  As a result of piracies of his engravings Hogarth instigated an Engraver's Copyright Act, delaying the publication of his second great moral series, A Rake's Progress, until the act became law in 1735.  By this time, however, the Rake had already been pirated.  Also in 1735 he founded the better known St. Martin's Lane Academy, where by all accounts he was an inspiring teacher; the academy quickly became the focus of avant-garde rococo art in Britain.To forestall the commission's going to a foreigner, Giacomo Amiconi, Hogarth offered to paint without payment two large murals over the staircase of Saint Bartholomew's Hospital; he completed these in 1737.  Enraged at the success of Jean-Baptiste Van Loo, another foreigner who had established himself in London in 1737, Hogarth turned to portraiture, and in 1740 presented his deliberately informal full-length of Captain Coram to the Foundling Hospital, of which he was a founding governor.  With the idea of creating a permanent exhibition where fashionable patrons could admire the best in contemporary British painting, he coordinated the donation by artists of paintings that would hang in the Foundling Hospital offices; the newly decorated Court Room was unveiled in 1747.  He also promoted the pictorial decoration at Vauxhall Gardens, the most popular of London's many pleasure gardens, which was owned by a friend of his.In 1743 Hogarth traveled to Paris to hire engravers for Marriage à la Mode, published in 1745.  The twelve plates of Industry and Idleness, cheap engravings intended for a wide public, for which no paintings were produced, followed in 1747.  The artist made a second trip to Paris in 1748 and was expelled from Calais, having been accused of spying.  The following year he bought a country house in Chiswick (now a Hogarth museum).  He remained active during the 1750s, and in 1757 was appointed Serjeant Painter to the King.  He resented Sir Richard Grosvenor's refusal to purchase Sigismunda, which in effect he had commissioned, and became increasingly embittered, a prey to persecution mania.  He was ill for a whole year between 1760 and 1761.  Although he contributed seven pictures to the Society of Artists exhibition in 1761, his health was in decline, and he died in Leicester Fields on 25 October 1764.

    "biography": "Jean-Baptiste Joseph Pater, son of the sculptor Antoine Pater (1670-1747), was born in 1695 in Valenciennes, the hometown of his teacher Jean Antoine Watteau (1684-1721). He began his training under the little-known painter Jean Baptiste Guidé (d. 1711) in 1706, though he left this artist's studio before the end of the decade. Later, Pater apprenticed to Watteau, probably following his master back to Paris after the latter made a return trip to his hometown of Valenciennes. The length of this second apprenticeship is unknown, but Pater's biographers indicate that it was not long. Feeling Watteau to be too impatient and of too difficult a disposition to teach a young pupil, Pater set out to teach himself to paint. Back in Valenciennes in 1715-1716, the young artist, with his father, was involved in a business venture that led to a sequence of well-documented conflicts with the Corporation of Saint Luke. Pater's desire to work independently of this governing body may indicate that he had never intended to remain in his birthplace for long, and by 1718 he was again in Paris, working within Watteau's circle. In 1721 the repentant Watteau summoned Pater. Nearing the end of his life, Watteau recalled the talent of his former pupil and wished to offer him instruction again. In the last month of Watteau's life, Pater reportedly came to learn all he knew of the art of painting. In subject matter, he adhered closely to his master, submitting in 1728 his Soldiers Celebrating (Paris, Musée du Louvre) as his morceau de réception. While Watteau had captured the ennui of camp life in his paintings of soldiers, those by Pater differed little from his fêtes galantes. In his exquisite pendants Concert Champêtre and Les Délassements de la campagne (Valenciennes, Musée des Beaux-Arts), groups of figures, some in aristocratic dress, some in theatrical costume, mingle with members of the opposite sex, flirting and conversing.      According to his biographers, Pater's prodigious output was at once a result of avarice and of the artist's fear of becoming infirm and unable to paint. Yet his desire to solidify his financial position is hardly surprising in light of the fact that he received his formative artistic instruction only after his career was well underway. This fact also explains why many of his notable achievements were produced in the last decade of his short life. At the end of the 1720s, Pater began work on a series of fourteen scenes from Paul Scarron's Roman Comique (Potsdam, Nouveau Palais), which shortly thereafter were reproduced as engravings. In spite of contemporary criticism, which maintained that Pater sacrificed ordered compositions for mere technical facility, one of the artist's most complex and ambitious images--the Fair at Bezons of c. 1733 (New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art)--is also one of his most successful. Most of his paintings were purchased by collectors and amateurs, including Friedrich II of Prussia (Frederick the Great), but in the last year of his life Pater received a royal commission from Louis XV to paint a Chinese Hunt (Amiens, Musée de Picardie) for the Petite Galerie in Versailles, which was decorated with eight additional exotic hunting scenes by the most accomplished of Pater's contemporaries. Pater became ill and died in 1736 at the early age of forty-one.[Frances Gage, in French Paintings of the Fifteenth through the Eighteenth Century, The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue, Washington, D.C., 2009: 361.]",

    "biography": "Nicolas Lancret has often been regarded as a close imitator of Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684-1721), but his paintings are imprinted with a distinctly personal stamp. Less steeped in fantasy and theater than those of his predecessor, Lancret's fêtes galantes seem to reflect contemporary society more directly. Although Lancret remained, like Watteau, a painter of genre scenes, his production encompassed subgenres that had not held much interest for the older artist, including conversation pieces, allegorical images, and scenes of children and adults playing games.      After a short period of training as an engraver, Lancret apprenticed to the obscure history painter Pierre Dulin (1669-1749), and shortly thereafter he enrolled in the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture. Only a few years later he left Dulin's studio to enter that of Claude Gillot (1673-1722), Watteau's former teacher, a decision that announced his future career as a genre painter and the abandonment of his aspirations to become a history painter. The period in which Lancret trained with Gillot cannot be established, yet it must have coincided with Watteau's acceptance into the Académie in 1712 as a painter of the fête galante. Lancret was never Watteau's pupil, but the friendship that resulted from their contact through Gillot inspired Lancret to absorb Watteau's innovations. In 1719, Lancret submitted as his morceau de reception for acceptance into the Académie a conversation galante (possibly the version in the Wallace Collection, London), a painting utterly imbued with Watteau. His stylistic indebtedness to Watteau survived the rupture of their friendship and the latter's death in 1721, yet it was not long before Lancret infused his sujets galants with his own stylistic idiom, replacing Watteau's shimmering surfaces with a bolder use of color. He exhibited several paintings at the Salon of 1725, none of which can be identified with certainty, but which included a dance in a landscape, a return after the hunt, and a representation of women bathing. The latter two were subjects to which Lancret, unlike Watteau, would frequently return. In the same year, he exhibited a portrait of the man who would later write his biography, Ballot de Sovot. Lancret painted his celebrated portraits of Mademoiselle Camargo, the exceptionally popular dancer at the Paris Opera, before the end of the 1720s (one of them is NGA 1937.1.89).      Lancret's first royal commission was for a representation of contemporary history, one of the few history paintings the artist produced in the course of his career. Although now lost, surviving documents indicate that this painting portrayed the conveyance of Maria Leszczynska's ladies-in-waiting in a cart of straw after the carriage transporting the entourage of the future queen of France became stuck in the mud on the road to Fontainebleau. The depiction of this amusing incident heralded two defining characteristics of Lancret's art: humor and anecdote. Another humorous work, Le Déjeuner de Jambon (Chantilly, Musée Condé), representing a group of giddy carousers and their well-behaved servants, was produced in 1735 for Louis XV's private dining room in Versailles. Humor and anecdote emerge again in the second half of the 1730's in Lancret's series The Times of Day (London, National Gallery). As in Le Déjeuner de Jambon, the first image in the series, Le Matin, exposes the improprieties of the aristocracy, scarcely veiled by the elegant surroundings and beautiful possessions so delicately rendered by Lancret's brush. Human folly is mocked in a group of paintings, many of which Lancret exhibited at the Salon of 1738, representing fables of La Fontaine.      Lancret's early death in 1743 did not halt the fervor with which several important European collectors sought his paintings. They included Ange Laurent de La Live de Jully (1725-1779), to whom Le Déjeuner de Jambon passed by 1756. The most significant of these collectors was not a Frenchman but Friedrich II, King of Prussia (Frederick the Great), who, at his pleasure palace Sanssouci, in Potsdam, exhibited twenty-six paintings by the artist. Lancret's paintings were also widely known through engraved reproductions from 1730 on.[Frances Gage, in French Paintings of the Fifteenth through the Eighteenth Century, The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue, Washington, D.C., 2009: 278-279.]",

    "biography": "Joseph Highmore was born in London on 13 June 1692.  He was educated at merchant Taylors' School.  His father failed to get him started as a painter as pupil of his uncle, Thomas, who had been appointed Sergeant Painter to Queen Anne in 1702, and he was articled to an attorney in 1707.  In 1713 he enrolled in Kneller's Academy of Painting on Great Queen Street, and, after his articles expired, set himself up in 1715 as a portrait painter in the City.  In 1716 he married Susanna Hiller, with whom he had two children.Highmore was a founding member of Chéron and Vanderbank's Saint Martin's Land Academy in 1720.  In 1724 he moved to Lincoln's Inn Fields, began to paint sitters of greater distinction than City merchants, and executed drawings for a folio of engravings of the installation of the Knights of Bath, published in 1730, which led to aristocratic commissions.  He traveled via the Low Countries to see the princely collections at Düsseldorf in 1732; he visited Paris in 1734, partly to study contemporary art.  His most rococo production was a series of twelve paintings illustrating Richardson's Pamela, engraved in 1745.  He also painted biblical subjects, and some landscapes.Highmore maintained his busy portrait practice without studio assistance, executing the draperies himself and painting the hands from life; the heads were often completed in one sitting.  He exhibited at the first exhibition of the Society of Artists in 1760 but retired in 1762, selling his collection of paintings and going to live with his daughter and son-in-law in Canterbury.A  freemason and nonconformist, Highmore seems to have moved in learned and literary rather than artistic circles.  He was himself a writer, chiefly in his retirement, of pamphlets and articles on varied subjects, including perspective.  He died in Canterbury on 3 March 1780, at the age of eighty-seven.

    "biography": "Born in 1700 into a prominent family of magistrates and lawyers in Aix-en-Provence, Michel François Dandré-Bardon passed his adolescence anticipating a legal career. At the age of twenty, he departed his native town for the capital intending to study law, but he entered the studio of another native Aixois, Jean Baptiste Van Loo (1684-1745), under whom he received his first training alongside Carle Van Loo (1705-1765). In his study of ancient art and anatomy, as in copying the academies of his master, Dandré-Bardon demonstrated rapid progress. Jean Baptiste's financial hardship may have constrained him to undertake the restoration of the frescoes in Fontainebleau and his pupil Dandré-Bardon to transfer to the studio of Jean François de Troy (1679-1752) in 1723. Anticipating the artistic interests of his mature career, the young painter immediately set to copying works by great Venetian masters, producing paintings of a soft and sensuous style. He soon entered the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture. In the competition for the Rome Prize in 1725, he took only second place with his While Playing, the Infant Moses Makes the Crown Fall from the Head of Pharaoh (location unknown). Nevertheless, the Académie de France in Rome agreed to accept him on condition that his parents pay his expenses, and he left for the southern city, where he would stay for the next five years. A central component of his Roman years was the study of the art of antiquity as well as of Raphael (1483-1520) and the masters of the Bolognese school-Annibale Carracci (bapt. 1560-1609), Domenichino (1581-1641), and Guido Reni (1575-1642). With a marked talent for facility and gracefulness, Dandré-Bardon showed an affinity with Pietro da Cortona (1596?-1669). In 1730, he visited Venice for six months, observing the work of Giambattista Tiepolo (1696-1770) and almost certainly meeting Sebastiano Ricci (bapt. 1659-1734), whose art inspired him throughout his career.      The young painter returned to France via Aix-en-Provence, where a second version of his Augustus Punishing the Extortioners--he had judged his first version less than successful--was in place in the Audience Room of the Chambre des Comptes, having been sent from Italy. In 1731 the artist completed five more commissions in Aix. The only one that survives is Christ on the Cross (Aix-en-Provence, Saint-Esprit). A major decorative cycle--nine compositions, all destroyed during the French Revolution--was carried out for the Hôtel de Ville in Aix. Sketches survive for two of the compositions--The Union of the Procuration of Provence at the Council of Aix and The Inhabitants of Aix Giving Aid to Marseilles Against the Aragonais (both Aix-en-Provence, Musée Granet)--in which the force of swirling masses is matched by vibrant color. The painter is also known to have produced a few portraits.      Dandré-Bardon attempted to solidify his position in the Paris art world following his return to the capital in 1734. In that year, the Archbishop Charles Vintimille (1655-1746) commissioned him to paint the pendants Death of the Virgin and The Visit to Saint Elizabeth (both, location unknown) for the Capuchin Church in the Marais. Before installation, these paintings were exhibited in the Salon of 1734. Upon the submission in 1735 of Tullia Running Her Chariot over the Body of Her Father (Montpellier, Musée Fabre), he was received into the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture. Only a year later, he was made professor.      During a period when there was little demand for history painting from royal or private sources, Dandré-Bardon found patronage in the church. Through his association with the archbishop of Paris, he completed a major commission for the order of the Daughters of Saint Thomas de Villeneuve, in which he represented the founder of the order performing good works (Neuilly-sur-Seine, Daughters of Saint Thomas de Villeneuve). The paucity of commissions for historical scenes, however, led the artist to return to Aix, where he remained for the following decade, the most active of his career. Several of the large decorative schemes that he painted soon after he arrived in his birthplace--for the Société des Concerts and for the university--have been almost entirely lost. Dandré-Bardon devoted the five years between 1744 to 1749 to the decoration of the Salle des Actes at the university with four historical and two allegorical works, including another version of Christ on the Cross (lost) as well as the allegorical figure of Theology (Aix-en-Provence, Saint-Jean de Malte). During the same period, the artist completed a variety of religious commissions for the parish churches around Aix, including The Miracle of Saint Heldrad and the altarpiece Saint Crépin and Saint Crépinen (both Lambesc, Notre-Dame-du-Rosaire). Saint Jacques Interceding with the Virgin on Behalf of the Souls in Purgatory, in the same church, is one of his most lyrically beautiful works, employing a strikingly Venetian palette of pinks, yellows, and blues and demonstrates the painter's mastery in rendering different effects of light.      Over the last years of his life, Dandré-Bardon increasingly became engaged in the administration of academic organizations and in his official duties. At the same time that he accepted the post of controller of the decoration of the Royal Galleries in 1748, Dandré-Bardon was working on an Allegory of the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, known through preparatory drawings and an oil sketch (Aix-en-Provence, Musée Arnaud), but his composition apparently was never completed. Shortly thereafter, the painter returned to Paris to replace François Boucher (1703-1770) as professor in the Académie royale, resuming his life as an academician and advancing the movement to revive history painting in the grand manner. In spite of his dedication to history painting, Dandré-Bardon produced a few genre paintings for private collectors, the most notable of which is his series The Four Ages of Man (Aix-en-Provence, Musée Granet) painted in 1743-1744. His last known painting, The Death of Socrates (lost), was exhibited in the Salon of 1753 and heralded a new period of artistic seriousness. Dandré-Bardon was a founding member of the Marseille Académie, of which he became director in 1754. From this period on, he actively published a number of books and treatises, including the Traité de peinture (1765). When, ill health prevented him from painting, he continued to draw. He died in 1783.[Frances Gage, in French Paintings of the Fifteenth through the EIghteenth Century, The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue, Washington, D.C., 2009: 127.]",

    "biography": "Giovanni Paolo Panini, the most celebrated and popular view painter in eighteenth-century Rome, was born 17 June 1691 in Piacenza.  Although he prepared as a youth for a career in the Church, he studied perspective and architectural painting in his native city and had received some architectural training by the time of his arrival in Rome in November 1711.  Although already recognized as an independent painter of landscapes and architectural and perspective views, Panini attended the drawing academy of the figure painter Benedetto Luti until about 1717-1718.  The formative influences upon his style were the classical ruin paintings of Giovanni Ghisolfi, the landscapes of Jan Van Bloemen and Andrea Locatelli, and the topographical views of Gaspar Van Wittel (1653-1736).In his early years Panini established himself principally as a fresco decorator of the villas and palaces of the Roman ecclesiastical intelligentsia and aristocracy.  In 1718 Panini was elected to the Congregazione dei Virtuosi al Pantheon and in 1719 to the Accademia di San Luca in Rome; in 1754 and 1755 he served as the Academy's president, or principe.  Panini's associations with the French in Rome advanced his career significantly, particularly after 1724 when he married the sister-in-law of Nicolas Vleughels, director of the Académie de France at Rome.  Panini taught perspective there and in 1732 was received as a member of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture in Paris, an honor accorded few Roman artists.  Patronized by Cardinal Melchior de Polignac, Louis XV's chargé d'affaires in Rome from 1724 to 1732, and by the Duc de Choiseul, French Ambassador to Benedict XIV, he influenced younger French painters like Claude-Joseph Vernet, Hubert Robert, and Jean-Nicolas Servandoni, who traveled to Rome to complete their education.Although Panini worked as an architect, designing Cardinal Valenti's villa and the chapel in Santa Maria della Scala (1728), and produced fireworks, festival apparatuses, and other ephemeral architectural decorations (and painted magnificent records of them), in the last thirty years of his life he specialized in painting the views of Rome that secured his lasting reputation.  These were of two main types, vedute prese da i luoghi (carefully and accurately rendered views of actual places) and vedute ideate (imaginary views and combinations of particular buildings and monuments).  His views of ancient and modern Rome encompassed practically everything worth noting in the eighteenth-century guidebooks to the Eternal City.  These paintings were not idealized or symbolic representations of Rome's past and present grandeur, but accurate and objective portrayals of the most famous, most picturesque, or most memorable sights of the city.  In the 1740s and 1750s, Panini produced numerous views of ancient and contemporary Rome to meet the growing demand for such highly commercial paintings created by foreign visitors to the city on the Grand Tour.  The popularity of his paintings among the British in particular is confirmed by the the large number of paintings (and many replicas and copies) with a British provenance.In addition to the view paintings for which he is best known, Panini produced religious and historical scenes, records of contemporary historical events, real and imaginary architectural pieces, and fantasy views of Roman ruins.  The tremendous size of Panini's oeuvre, the number of extant versions of certain compositions, and the mechanized and routine handling characterizing many of these canvases confirm that he relied upon an extensive workshop to produce reproductions of his more popular compositions.  Panini's son Francesco served as his principal studio assistant and, after the artist's death in Rome on October 21, 1765, supplied drawings after his compositions to engravers.

    "biography": "In spite of the efforts by Louis Dimier over a century ago to identify this very little-known painter and decorator, Christophe Huet is still sometimes confused with other members of his family who were artists. Dimier distinguished between Christophe Huet and his brother Nicolas (1770-1830), a painter of flowers and fruit, who was known as Huet Le Jeune. Nicolas' son, the painter and engraver Jean Baptiste Huet I (1745-1811), has likewise been confused with his uncle, since both artists produced images of animal subjects. Christophe, if quickly forgotten after his death, was the most successful artist of the family, and he enjoyed a solid reputation in his own day. Moreover, within his twin areas of specialization, decorative and animal painting, he was one of the most prominent artists of his generation. He found patrons in the highest levels of society, including the duchesse du Maine (1676-1753) and the marquise de Pompadour (1721-1764), who owned several of his animal paintings and for whom Huet painted a salon chinois at the Château de Champs.      Although Huet is best known today for his chinoiserie and singerie, it is likely he received his early training from one of two animal painters, Jean Baptiste Oudry (1686-1755) or François Desportes (1661-1743). In 1753 a critic linked Huet to Oudry, but there is more evidence to suggest that Huet's master was Desportes. The work of Desportes was well represented in Huet's collection, as Roger-Armand Weigert in 1952 showed from the inventory drawn up after the artist's death. On several occasions Desportes collaborated with the decorator Claude III Audran (1658-1734), including at the menagerie of Versailles, where Huet later went to draw animals from life. If Desportes was responsible for Huet's artistic formation, so, too, was Audran, alongside whom Huet worked at the château d'Anet. More important, as one of the first artists of eighteenth-century France to develop a form of decorative painting in which monkeys performed human activities, Audran was a primary reference point when Huet was inventing his Singeries, ou, Différentes actions de la vie humaine représentées par les singes, published in 1741 by the engraver Jean Guélard (active 1710-1730).      To judge from the number of Huet's submissions to the Salons of the Académie de Saint Luc in 1751, 1752, and 1756, his reputation as an animal painter must have been considerable. In 1756, only three years before his death, the artist presented twelve animal pictures, many of which were recorded as belonging to unnamed members of the aristocracy. Huet executed the pictorial decoration in a number of eighteenth-century townhouses in Paris and châteaux in the surrounding area, but the chronology of many of his works has yet to be established. The chinoiseries at the Château de Champs consist of single Chinese figures, scenes of hunting and game playing, and light arabesque ornamentation formed of shells and palms. In the salon of the Hôtel de Rohan, where Huet integrated Chinese pastoral scenes with animals, medallions, and floral decoration, he reached a particularly high level of inventiveness. Following closely upon the heels of Huet's collaboration at the château d'Anet with Claude III Audran in 1733, he worked at the Château de Chantilly painting oriental landscapes and animals in the grand salon.      The majority of Huet's activity was decorative and animal painting, but the inventory of his possessions indicates that he also worked as a portraitist. The three portraits recorded-one of each of his parents and a third of himself in the guise of a hunter-may indicate that he produced these objects for his personal pleasure.[Frances Gage, in French Paintings of the Fifteenth through the Eighteenth Century, The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue, Washington, D.C., 2009: 259.]",

    "biography": "Alessandro Magnasco was born in 1667 in Genoa to the moderately successful painter Stefano (c. 1635-c. 1672).  After his father died prematurely, Alessandro was sent to Milan to learn commerce.  Instead, Alessandro induced his Milanese patron to cover the expenses of an apprenticeship with the esteemed painter Filippo Abbiati (1640-1715), probably around 1680.  By the 1690s, the young Magnasco had completed his training and established himself as a portrait painter.  He was known as Lissandrino in his own time.This phase of his career must have been short-lived, however, because already by 1695, the date of his first signed work, Meeting of Quakers, Magnasco was painting scenes from contemporary life.  Magnasco's subjects and his lively, almost burlesque, figures owe much to the prints of Jacques Callot (1592-1635) and Stefano Della Bella (1610-1664).  Like them, Magnasco began creating scenes that defy easy classification as either history paintings or genre, with smaller figures set in lush landscapes, lavish or spare interiors, as well as in classical ruins.Magnasco also began to collaborate with painters of landscapes and ruins, as indicated by seventeenth- and eighteenth-century inventories that include his works and specify joint attributions.  Throughout his career in Milan and Florence (1690s- c. 1735) Magnasco worked with the landscapist Giovanni Antonio Peruzzini from Ancona (1668- c. 1725), as well as with Crescenzio Onofri and Marco Ricci (1676-1729), among others.  Additionally, Magnasco collaborated with Clemente Spera (late 17th century-c. 1730), a specialist in architectural ruins.Magnasco's artistic formation seems to depend on Lombard traditions, particularly those embodied by his teacher, Abbiati.  He also appears to have assimilated the compositional and coloristic idiosyncracies of Valerio Castello (1624-1659) and Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione (1609-1664).  The means by which Magnasco actually came to know their works is contested.  Whereas it is known that Magnasco always maintained contacts with Genoa, there is no firm evidence that he travelled there prior to his permanent return around 1735.Magnasco received important commissions in Milan from Giovanni Francesco Arese (who owned at least twenty-two of Magnasco's paintings) and other prominent families.  The Milanese enjoyed Magnasco's unusual subjects, which highlighted both issues of social reform and contemporary social ills.  Included among these were scenes of catechism, monastic life, ceremonies and rituals of Jewish and protestant sects, brigands or beggars, the treatment of prisoners, and ceremonies of witches and devils.  In the first decade of the eighteenth century Magnasco moved to Florence, where he was an intimate of Grand Prince Ferdinando and his court.  The Medici circle, in fact, provided the majority of his commissions.  When Magnasco returned to Milan around 1709, his success continued with distinguished requests from the Austrian governor (1719-1725), Gerolamo di Colloredo, for a series of paintings concerning life among the capuchins and other religious sects.Returning to Genoa around 1735, however, Magnasco found that the concerns of cultivated Milanese and Florentine aristocrats, those who sympathized with the religious reformers and the writers of picaresque novels, were not shared by patrons in his native city.  During the last decade and a half of his life (1735-1749), Magnasco's style--which, Ratti writes, was condemned as \"worthless\" and \"ridiculous\"--and subject matter encountered a resistant audience in Genoa.  Nonetheless, Magnasco continued to paint until an advanced age [perhaps for Lombard clients] and held forth with students and amateurs even when he was no longer able to wield his brushes.  Although Magnasco had collaborators and assistants throughout his career, there were few real students who carried on his stylistic or iconographic innovations after his death in Genoa in 1749.  Among the artists identified as followers of Magnasco are Ciccio Napoletano and Coppa Milanese, about whom little is known.

    "biography": "Giuseppe Angeli was born in 1712 in Venice and entered the shop of Giovanni Battista Piazzetta at an undetermined date, probably before he was twenty years old.  By 1741 he was officially registered as an independent painter, but instead of establishing his own studio he became the director of Piazzetta's workshop. Among the painters employed by Piazzetta, Angeli was the most adept at imitating the master's style.  Angeli soon succeeded, however, in cultivating his own circle of influential patrons in Venice and its mainland territories.  He is not known to have left the city for study or work.Early in his career, Angeli produced works of all the types turned out by Piazzetta's shop, including genre paintings, half-length devotional images, decorative cycles, and the large religious paintings that would be the major focus of his own career.  His style derived primarily from his teacher's late manner, although he was receptive to other contemporary developments, particularly the refined elegance and lighter palettes of Giovanni Battista Tiepolo  and Jacopo Amigoni (1682-1752).  His earliest works, of the 1730s and 1740s, are the most indebted to his master.  Angeli's evolving style of the 1750s and 1760s was influenced by the incipient neo-classical style and by new Enlightenment ideals among the Venetian ecclesiastics who were his chief patrons, and his altarpieces of this period tend to increased simplicity and clarity of outline.  His last church commissions of the 1770s, however, return to his first style.In addition to large altarpieces, Angeli also executed decorative commissions in palaces and villas; in these he was less innovative, simply reworking earlier treatments of historical and mythological scenes.  He was repeatedly employed by the Scuola di San Rocco, where he executed a number of ceiling paintings, restored works by Jacopo Tintoretto (1518-1594), and even repainted unrestorable compositions by Tintoretto and Pordenone (1483/1484-1539).  In the 1770s he returned to small devotional images and turned as well to painting portraits of his influential patrons, following the conventions of official portraiture as practiced by Alessandro Longhi (1733-1813).Elected drawing master in 1756, Angeli was long a leading member of the Venetian Academy until the later 1770s.  He received a medal of honor from the Venetian government in 1774 for his accomplishments in religious painting.  Thereafter, however, his art was less and less in demand due to the religious and social upheavals that preceded the fall of the Venetian Republic in 1797.  He died in Venice in 1798.

    "biography": "Born in Paris in 1715, Louis-Joseph Le Lorrain combined, as Pierre Jean Mariette put it, \"several talents that made him recommendable.\" He was a painter, printmaker, draftsman, illustrator, and painter of interiors; he conceived theatrical sets; and he was noted as a furniture designer. Trained as a painter by Jacques Dumont Le Romain (1701-1781), he won the Prix de Rome in 1739. He studied at the Académie de France in Rome from December 1740 until March 1749. Le Lorrain engraved architectural designs for the temporary centerpiece of the annual Chinea festival in Rome (1745-1747). These early neoclassical designs show Le Lorrain's absorption of the classicizing aesthetic of Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-1778), for whose opere varie he etched the frontis vignette (1750). He worked extensively as an engraver and as an illustrator of mostly French books, designing decorative elements and frontispieces as well as various figures and vignettes. In the 1750s he prepared the drawings for Claude Henri Watelet's (1718-1786) suite of engraved vase designs Raccolta di vasi (1757) and Julien David Leroy's (1724-1803) Ruines des plus beaux monuments de la Grèce (1758).      Back in Paris after 1750 under the protection of the antiquarian, the comte de Caylus (1692-1765), Le Lorrain executed ceiling decorations in encaustic (wax) for several Paris hôtels particuliers. Between 1753 and 1756 he also provided drawings and cartoons for the royal tapestry works at Aubusson. Named a member agréé (provisional) of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture on January 29, 1752, Le Lorrain exhibited paintings at the Salons of 1753, 1755, and 1757. On July 24, 1756, he was officially received in the Académie as a history painter with a mythological scene, Cupid Transforming the Nymph Peristera into a Dove (location unknown). Le Lorrain exhibited mostly religious, mythological, and allegorical pictures, but at the Salon of 1755 he showed two paintings done in encaustic: a floral still life and a costumed figure. This technique of mixing pigment with molten wax had been revived by Caylus, and Le Lorrain's paintings using this process were notable enough to be mentioned in Diderot's Encyclopédie. No doubt through the influence of Caylus, Le Lorrain produced his most significant creations: his designs for a suite of ebony neo-Greek cabinet furniture built during the years 1756-1758 for the well-known Parisian amateur Ange Laurent de La Live de Jully.      As Mariette recounts, Le Lorrain's worries about his professional prospects led him to travel to Russia in early 1758 as the \"First Painter of the Empress of all Russias, [and] Director of her Academy of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture at St. Petersburg.\" There, Le Lorrain taught pupils the rudiments of history painting while he continued his essays in encaustic, medal designs, portraits, and decorative ensembles. His tenure was short. A \"victim of the somber, wintry weather of Russia,\"[1] Le Lorrain succumbed to pneumonia at the age of forty-four in 1759.[1]  M.

    "biography": "Giovanni Antonio Canal was born in Venice on October 17 or 18, 1697 to a well-defined class in Venetian society, just below the ranks of the patrician nobility.  His father, Bernardo Canal, was a painter of theatrical scenery and a view painter, and Canaletto appears to have assisted him at an early stage in the role of theater designer.  In 1719-1720 he accompanied his father to Rome to execute scenes for two operas by Alessandro Scarlatti performed there during the Carnival of 1720.  While in Rome, according to Anton Maria Zanetti, one of the artist's earliest biographers, the young man abandoned the theatre and began to draw and paint architectural views.  Canaletto's name was inscribed for the first time in the register of the Venetian artists' guild in 1720, which suggests a date for the beginning of his career as pittor di vedute, or view painter.  He adopted the diminutive Canaletto (the little Canal) by the mid-1720s, presumably to distinguish his work from his father's.The first firm date in Canaletto's career must be regarded as 1725, when Alessandro Marchesini, a Veronese painter living in Venice, opened negotiations for a pair of large views for Stefano Conti of Lucca.  Owen McSwiney, a bankrupt opera impresario living in Italy as an agent for various English noblemen in the commissioning of pictures, first introduced Canaletto to an English client, the Duke of Richmond, and in the late 1720s encouraged the artist to paint small topographical views of Venice with a commercial appeal for tourists and foreign visitors to the city.  The years 1727-1730 were crucial to the development of Canaletto's career and witnessed the decisive change from his early theatrical views to a cooler appraisal of the familiar sights of Venice.Sometime before 1728, Canaletto began his association with Joseph Smith, an English businessman and collector living in Venice, who was to become the artist's principal agent and patron.  Smith eventually acquired nearly fifty paintings, one hundred fifty drawings, and fifteen rare etchings from Canaletto, the largest and finest single group of the artist's works, that he sold to King George III in 1763.  The publication in 1735 of Antonio Visentini's engravings after twelve views of the Grand Canal (Prospectus Magni Canalis Venetiarum), which Smith had commissioned from Canaletto around 1730, did much to arouse enthusiasm for the artist among the English, and during the next decade a large number of Canaletto's paintings entered English collections under Smith's auspices.  The period between 1730 and 1742 was the most productive of Canaletto's career; it was in these years that almost all of the paintings of Venice by which he is best known were completed and during which he produced much of his best work.  In this, the second period of his career, Canaletto's chief aim was to present an accurate and detailed record of a particular scene, and he captured the light, the life, and the buildings of Venice in these years with a perceptiveness and luminosity that established his reputation as one of the greatest topographical painters of all time.The outbreak of the War of the Austrian Succession in 1741 significantly disrupted the flow of foreign visitors to Venice, and the demand for Canaletto's work on the part of the English declined considerably.  Joseph Smith encouraged the artist to devote more time to drawing and to take up etching, which formed a small but significant part of his artistic activity.  After Smith's appointment as British Consul in Venice in 1744, a volume of Canaletto's etchings was published as Vedute altre prese da i luoghi altre ideate.  In 1740 and 1741 Canaletto left Venice on a tour of the Brenta and the mainland and made a number of drawings on the spot which served as the source for paintings and particularly etchings which he produced in the studio upon his return.  He was accompanied on this trip by Bernardo Bellotto, the son of his sister Fiorenza, who had been in his studio since about 1735 and must have played an increasing role in the production of the studio.In 1746 Canaletto departed Venice for England where he worked for the next decade.  A number of Venetian artists of the preceding generation had found success there, and Canaletto's name and work were widely known in the country, especially in aristocratic circles.  No absolutely precise dates have been established for his stay in England; Canaletto returned briefly to Venice once during his English sojourn in 1750-1751, and he appears to have left permanently sometime after 1755.  The impact which Canaletto made on English landscape and topographical painters lasted well into the following century.In spite of Canaletto's success with the English and other foreign patrons, contemporary Venetians appear to have held his view painting in low esteem:  none of his patrons was Venetian, and he was not elected to the Venetian academy until 1763, following a previous refusal.  In the traditional view, Canaletto's paintings after 1756 seldom display the imagination and technical skill, the freshness and vitality of his earlier work.  In fact, he produced pictures of high quality in his last years, like the architectural capriccio of the interior of the courtyard of a palace (Galleria Accademia, Venice), an exercise in perspective that he gave the Academy in 1765 as his reception piece.  In August 1767 he attended a meeting of the Academy.  Seven months later, on April 19, 1768, Canaletto died of inflammation of the bladder and was buried in Venice.

    "biography": "Bernardo Bellotto is believed to have been born in Venice on 20 May 1722 to Fiorenza Domenica Canal and Lorenzo Bellotto. The artist's traditional birthdate, 30 January 1721, is evidently that of his elder brother Michiel Bernardo Antonio Eugenio, according to documentation cited in Bozena Anna Kowalczyk, \"Il Bellotto veneziano nei documenti,\" Arte Veneta 47 (1995):69-77.  The painter's given names are recorded in a baptismal document in the Archivio della Curia Patriacale, Venice, as Bernardo Francesco Paolo Ernesto.Bellotto's mother was the eldest of the three sisters of the Venetian vedutista Antonio Canaletto, and Bellotto entered his uncle's Venetian studio for training as a view painter around 1735.  During this apprenticeship, which lasted until the early 1740s, he assimilated so thoroughly the manner of Canaletto's methods and style--a phenomenon remarked by their contemporaries--that the problem of attributing works from this period to one painter or the other continues to the present day.Bellotto was enrolled as early as 1738 in the register of the Fraglia dei Pittori, the Venetian painter's guild, which suggests that by then he had developed into an independent painter, draftsman, and etcher.  By 1740 he was capable of faultless perspective drawing, and he had produced several independent oil paintings of Venetian scenes.  In the years 1740-1741, Bellotto accompanied his uncle on a visit to the neighboring mainland along the Brenta to Padua, and on this trip he attained his majority as an artist.  For several months in 1742 Bellotto travelled in central Italy visiting Florence, Lucca, and Rome.  The paintings produced during this time anticipate his distinctive mature style and eventual divergence from the manner of Canaletto.Bellotto probably returned to Venice before the end of 1742; he was certainly there in 1743.  From 1744 onwards, before his departure for Dresden in the summer of 1747, he spent months at a time in Lombardy, Piedmont, and Verona, where he executed a large number of paintings of new subjects.  During this period he began to take an interest in the surroundings of towns and in landscape, which had previously played a minor role in his work.  The most important of Bellotto's Italian works are generally thought to be two views of the village of Gazzada near Varese (Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan).  In 1745 Bellotto executed two views of Turin for Charles Emmanuel III, King of Sardinia and Duke of Savoy.  They were his first royal commissions, and he signed them with both his Christian name and surname and the byname \"Il Canaletto,\" no doubt to draw attention to his relationship with his celebrated uncle.In July 1747, in response to a summons to the court of Dresden, he left Venice forever.  From the moment of his arrival until the outbreak of the Seven Years War in 1756, Bellotto was engaged in the service of Augustus II, Elector of Saxony (and as Augustus III, King of Poland) and of his powerful Prime Minister, Count Heinrich von Brühl.  In 1748 the title of Court Painter was officially conferred on the artist, and his annual salary was the highest ever paid by Augustus II to a painter. Between 1747 and the first months of 1753, Bellotto painted fourteen large panoramic views of Dresden, and between 1753 and 1756, eleven views of the suburb of Pirna.  These twenty-five paintings are among the painter's most significant works.  In these paintings Bellotto developed a highly original style impossible to confuse with that of his uncle.A new phase was ushered in with Bellotto's move to Vienna in the winter of 1758-1759, where he remained until early in 1761.  The thirteen large canvases recording the principal attractions of Vienna, painted for Empress Maria Theresa and emphasizing her palaces and those constructed at her behest, constitute his second great series devoted to the portrayal of a single city and its immediate environment.  Following his departure from Vienna in early 1761, Bellotto visited the court of Elector Maximilian III Joseph of Bavaria in Munich before returning to Dresden shortly before the end of the year.Bellotto's second period of residence in Dresden, 1761-1766, was marked by financial difficulties caused by the destruction of his home in Pirna during the war, the deaths of Augustus III and Count Brühl within a few months of each other in 1763, and a change in the direction of the artistic affairs of the Saxon court in favor of native artists.  In order to eke out a living Bellotto served as the equivalent of a tutor in perspective at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts, recently established in 1764, and he made and sold prints.  He also produced a large number of replicas of his earlier views of Pirna, Köningstein, Vienna, and Munich, most of them in reduced formats.  The high technical standard of some indicate that they were painted entirely by his own hand; many others were completed with the assistance of members of his studio, notably his son Lorenzo.  Bellotto also produced two unusual views of war-torn Dresden, and large numbers of capriccios and vedute ideate.In December 1766, Bellotto and his son left Dresden with the intention of travelling to St. Petersburg and working for the Empress of Russia, Catherine II.  He arrived in Warsaw probably before the end of January 1767 and was immediately offered employment at the court of the last king of Poland, Stanislaus II August Poniatowski.  He was appointed Court Painter in 1768, and spent the last fourteen years of his life in working for the king in relative comfort and security.  His most important work from this period is a series of twenty-six views of Warsaw, intended for a particular suite, the so-called \"Canaletto Hall,\" in the Royal Castle.  These views, with their extraordinary topographical precision and scrupulous attention to detail, played an important role in the reconstruction of Warsaw following the Second World War.  Bellotto also produced, together with his son, an extraordinary amount of work for the royal residences at Ujazdów and Lazienki, on the outskirts of the city.  He died in Warsaw on November 17, 1780.  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "Pietro Longhi was born in 1702 in Venice, the son of Alessandro Falca, a silversmith.  He studied drawing and modelling with his father, and for his initial training as a painter he was apprenticed to Antonio Balestra until the end of 1718.  In the 1720s and 1730s Longhi received a number of public commissions for large-scale religious pictures in Venice which remain mostly untraced.  An altarpiece of 1732 in the parish church of San Pellegrino reveals the strong influence of Balestra.Longhi's frescoes completed in 1734 depicting the Fall of the Giants above the principal staircase in the Ca' Sagredo, Venice, reveal his limited talent for history painting on a large scale, and it may have been the disastrous critical reception of this commission that led to his dramatic shift toward genre paintings of contemporary life.  His earliest identifiable genre works consist of pastoral motifs and peasant interiors on small canvases that appear to date from the mid-1730s.  In their handling, subject matter, and naturalistic detail these works owe a debt to north Italian and Bolognese low-life and rustic painting, particularly the work of Giuseppe Maria Crespi, in whose studio Longhi is said to have studied, although the date of a visit to Bologna and activities there are not documented.  Whether he actually studied with Crespi is doubtful.Longhi's development as a painter in the 1730s remains unclear, but a concert scene dated 1741 in the Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice, shows his inventive approach to genre painting already fully developed.  In his Abecedario pittorico of 1753, Pietro Orlandi lauded Longhi's \"new and individual style of painting conversation pieces, games, ridotti, masquerades, parlors, all on a small scale and with such veracity and color that at a glance it was easy to recognize the places and people portrayed.\"  For such paintings, he adopted the simple format or a shallow, windowless stage, and he restricted his compositions to relatively few figures in restrained poses.  His soft, delicate brushwork is reminiscent of that of Jacopo Amigoni (1682-1752) and his palette reveals the influence of the pastels of Rosalba Carriera (1675-1757).In addition to his Venetian contemporaries and the realists of Bergamo, Brescia, and Bologna, several other sources influenced Longhi's development.  First noted by P. J. Mariette in the eighteenth century, Longhi's rapport with contemporary French painting has long been observed, and engravings of and after Lancret, Mercier, Pater, de Troy, and Watteau are cited among the models for his genre style.  Other writers have sought sources for his style in seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish painting, which was to be seen in Venice at the period.  Contemporary references to Longhi as the creator of \"speaking caricatures\" led inevitably to the comparison of his genre paintings with the graphic work of Hogarth, readily available in Venetian printshops by 1740, although Longhi's conversation pieces lacked the same satirical intention.Longhi's great pictorial sensibility and delicate sense of humor and his selective and careful depictions of contemporary Venetian life brought him immediate success.  Longhi's felicitous rendering of Venetian life proved especially popular within a restricted element of Venetian patrician society, and he is recorded as working for the Emo, Grimani, Pisani, Querini, Rezzonico, and Sagredo families.  A clue to the contemporary reception of his work is given by a Venetian journalist, Gaspare Gozzi, who admired Longhi because \"he portrays in his canvases what he sees with his own eyes\" in contrast to the history painters who paint \"figures dressed in ancient fashion and characters of fancy.\"Between 1740 and the mid-1750s Longhi's iconographic repertory focused primarily on conversation pieces; thereafter he widened his practice to include out-of-doors subjects like hunting parties and portraits.  The outstanding works of Longhi's career are seven paintings of the Sacraments made in the early 1750s for the Querini family (Galleria Querini Stampalia, Venice).  Longhi occasionally painted more than one version of his own compositions, but more often his works were duplicated by pupils and followers.  He developed his compositions with painstaking care, and he produced numerous drawings for the figures and other details in his paintings.In 1737 Longhi was elected to membership in the Fraglia, the Venetian guild of painters in which he remained active until 1773.  He was a founding member of the local academy of painters in 1756, instructor for its life classes until 1780, and a director from 1763-1766 of a private academy founded by the Pisani family.  Longhi's son, Alessandro (1733-1813), was also a painter and is best known for his portraits.  Longhi died on May 8, 1785 in the house in the quarter of San Rocco in Venice where he had lived since 1740.

    "biography": "Jean-Marc Nattier was the son of an insignificant portraitist of the reign of Louis XIV, Marc Nattier (1642-1705), and his wife, the miniaturist Marie Courtois (1655-1703). Born in Paris on March 17, 1685, he was the godchild of the history painter Jean Jouvenet (1644-1717), who was to play a role in his early artistic training. Nattier's mother, a paralytic, had given birth to several children, including a son, Jean Baptiste (1677-1726). In their youth the lives and careers of the two brothers were closely entwined. They learned the practical aspects of painting in their father's studio and attended the drawing and theoretical classes of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture, of which Marc Nattier was a member. The two were awarded a yearly stipend from the royal arts administration, the Bâtiments du Roi, and were prize winners in the Académie's student competitions. Their painting styles were remarkably similar, and Jean-Baptiste called himself Nattier l'aîné, while Jean-Marc often signed his early works as Nattier le jeune.      In 1702 Marc Nattier obtained a license to reproduce as engravings the twenty-four paintings comprising the monumental Marie de Médicis cycle by Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) in the Palais du Luxembourg. This was an enormous undertaking in which he involved his two sons, who executed the drawings (Paris, Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal) from which the most prominent French engravers of the time--among them Gérard Audran (1640-1703), Gérard Edelinck (1640-1707), Bernard Picart (1673-1733), and Gaspard Duchange (1662-1757)--made their reproductive prints. In 1709, at Jouvenet's instigation, Jean-Marc was offered a scholarship to study in Rome, but he declined the honor in order to further a lucrative career as a portraitist.      Before his death, Marc Nattier had deeded the Luxembourg engraving project to his sons, and in 1710 the prints were issued under the title Galerie du Palais du Luxembourg. Jean-Baptiste's official career as a history painter was launched when he was made an associate member (agréé) of the Académie, and as his diploma piece he painted Joseph and Potiphar's Wife (St. Petersburg, State Hermitage Museum). Around 1712 Jean-Marc made an elaborate drawing (Phoenix Art Museum) after Hyacinthe Rigaud's (1659-1743) famous Portrait of Louis XIV in Coronation Robes (Paris, Musée du Louvre); the sheet was the basis of Pierre Drevet's (1663-1738) reproductive engraving, and for it Nattier received 500 livres and encouragement from the king himself.      Jean-Marc prospered under the Regency. In 1715 his ambitions led him to seek membership in the Académie as a painter of history subjects. For the painting that was to earn him his reception three years later, he was assigned the mythological subject of Apollo Presiding over the Arts of Painting and Sculpture, for which he ultimately substituted Perseus Petrifying Phineus with the Head of the Gorgon (Tours, Musée des Beaux-Arts). In 1717 he was invited to join Peter the Great (r. 1682-1725) in Holland, and while in The Hague he began a portrait of the czar's peasant-born second wife Catherine Alexeyevna (St. Petersburg, State Hermitage Museum) and executed a generic battle piece intended to commemorate Russia's victory over the troops of Charles XII of Sweden at either Lesnaya or Poltava (Moscow, Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts). He then returned to Paris, where he painted from life a portrait of the czar wearing a suit of armor (Munich, Residenz Museum). The autocrat took serious umbrage at Nattier's refusal to settle in Russia as his court painter. In 1725, the artist sent his full-length military portrait of comte Maurice de Saxe (Dresden, Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister) to the Exposition de la Jeunesse.      Jean-Marc Nattier's practice as a court and society portraitist was firmly established by 1729, when he painted a likeness of Mademoiselle de Clermont (Chantilly, Musée Condé), the sister of the young Louis XV's prime minister, the duc de Bourbon. In this work, he combined portraiture with history painting, presenting his subject in the guise of a water nymph. For several decades his glamorous portraits of women made up as Greco-Roman deities and men outfitted as warriors or fabled heroes were all the rage. His mythological, allegorical, and fancy-dress portraits, set in luxurious interiors or serene landscapes, relied for their effect on sumptuous displays of fabrics and accessories. Moreover, while flattering his sitters, sometimes outrageously, he somehow managed to capture near-perfect likenesses. Such pictures were the staple products of his brush, and he was well within the tradition established by Pierre Mignard (1612-1695, cat. 72), Nicolas de Largillierre (1656-1746), and Jean Raoux (1677-1734). In contemporary minds, such idealized portraiture struck the same chords as the grandiloquent poetry of Voltaire (1694-1778) and the lush strains of the music of Jean Philippe Rameau (1683-1764). Because of their pseudo-mythological resonance, many of Nattier's works were treated as history pictures and replicated in engravings from which he derived income.      At this juncture the artist painted likenesses of two members of the house of Lorraine, Mademoiselle de Lambesc as Minerva and her brother, the comte de Brionne (Lille, Musée des Beaux-Arts, on deposit from the Musée du Louvre). A second portrait of Mademoiselle de Clermont depicting the sitter as a lady of the seraglio served by slaves (London, Wallace Collection) was an outstanding example of the eighteenth-century genre, the Turquerie. He also produced a full-length image of the duc de Richelieu wearing the elaborately decorated costume of a knight of the order of the Saint-Esprit (Lisbon, Museu Calouste Gulbenkian), a masterpiece of post-baroque French portraiture.      In 1734 the chevalier d'Orléans, grand prior of the order of Saint John of Jerusalem, engaged Nattier to complete the decoration of his painting gallery in the Palais du Temple, which Raoux had begun. There Nattier painted a series of six history pictures, the subjects of which have never been fully elucidated but are likely to have included several Muses (perhaps the Thalia and Terpsichore in the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, San Francisco, painted in 1739) and allegorical representations of Justice (Great Britain, private collection), Prudence (formerly collection of baron Maurice de Rothschild) and Fortitude (sale, New York, Christie's, November 2, 2000, no. 237), as well as a large, full-length portrait of his patron the grand prior as a military commander (location unknown).      Nattier became a regular exhibitor at the Salon from 1737 on. The publicity brought him a ceaseless flow of commissions from private and state sources. The famous Madame Geoffrin posed for him as a Sibyl (location unknown); and in contrast, her daughter, the marquise de la Ferté Imbault, is dressed for a masked ball (Tokyo, Fuji Museum). In 1740 the artist painted portraits of two daughters of the marquis de Nesles, both paramours of Louis XV (known from replicas in the Castle of Drottningholm and Versailles), whom he treated as personifications of Silence and Dawn. When shown at Versailles, these likenesses created such a stir that Queen Marie Leszczynska commissioned the artist to paint her daughter Madame Henriette reclining in a landscape and holding a crown of flowers, an attribute of the goddess Flora (Musée des Châteaux de Versailles et de Trianon). This was the first in a long series of portraits of the royal princesses, some done from life at the Abbaye de Fontevrault in Anjou, the works for which Nattier is perhaps best known (also in Versailles). Most of these paintings gave rise to autograph replicas and studio copies that were distributed to members of the royal family, other crowned heads, officers of the diplomatic corps, ministers, courtiers, and favorites of the Bourbon family.      Nattier exhibited seven works at the Salon of 1745, the year he painted a now-lost portrait of Louis XV (replica in St. Petersburg, State Hermitage Museum). In 1745 the artist was promoted to the rank of associate professor at the Académie. At the Salon that year, he showed a number of portraits, including the National Gallery of Art's Joseph Bonnier de la Mosson (1961.9.30). Nattier was soon called to the Château de Fontainebleau to paint the king's new mistress, the marquise de Pompadour, provocatively dressed as Diana, goddess of the hunt (Versailles). The following year he executed a knee-length portrait of Louis XV's son and heir, the Dauphin (replica in Musée de Dijon), clad in armor and standing before the field of the Battle of Fontenoy, a work that earned him the title of Painter in Ordinary to the King. In 1748, the artist sketched from life head studies of Louis XV's children--the twins Élisabeth, Duchess of Parma, and Henriette; Adélaïde; Victoire; and the dauphin, Louis Ferdinand--that were models for future portraits. When the opportunity arose, the fashionable Nattier was also capable of recording his sitters' features with a certain amount of psychological insight. No allegories were necessary to sustain his inspiration when he painted his sympathetic likeness of Marie Leszczynska (Versailles).      In January 1750, the dauphin commissioned Nattier to paint as overdoor decorations for his Grand Cabinet at Versailles portraits of his sisters disguised as the Four Elements (São Paulo, Museu de Arte Assis Chateaubriand), works that were exhibited at the Salon of 1751 along with a portrait of the dauphine Marie Josèphe de Saxe (Versailles). In 1752 the artist was made professor in the Académie.      By the mid-1750s Nattier's reputation was on the wane. His submissions to the Salon of 1755, which included the masterful portraits of Henriette playing the bass viol and the infant duc de Bourgogne (both in Versailles), elicited some vituperative commentary on the part of certain critics, who found his compositions pretentious and his coloring weak. In 1759 he was elected an associate member of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Art, and as his reception piece he executed a replica of a portrait of his son-in-law, the painter Louis Tocqué (Copenhagen, Royal Museum of Fine Arts). That year he exhibited a magnificent portrait of Madame Adélaïde holding a musical score (Paris, Musée du Louvre) and a Vestal (Raleigh, North Carolina Museum of Art), which aroused the scathing hostility of Diderot. In 1761 the sight of Nattier's posthumous portrait of the Duchess of Parma (Versailles) at the Salon prompted Diderot to exclaim: \"Does that man not have a friend who will tell him the truth?\" The old and infirm artist found himself in such difficult financial straits that he was obliged to sell his art collection and the contents of his studio. Jean-Marc Nattier died on November 7, 1766, in his eighty-first year, and his remains were entombed the following day in his parish church of Saint-Eustache.[Joseph Baillio, in French Paintings of the Fifteenth through the Eighteenth Century, The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue, Washington, D.C., 2009: 334-335.]",

    "biography": "John Wollaston, active between 1742 and 1775, was born in London, the son of portrait painter John Wollaston (c. 1672-1749).  His first firmly documented portrait was of evangelist George Whitefield (1742, engraved by John Faber).  Part of his training was with \"a noted drapery painter in London,\" according to Charles Willson Peale (letter to Rembrandt Peale, 28 October 1812). This was undoubtedly Joseph van Aken (c. 1699-1749), who completed the draperies for portraits by several London portrait painters, including Thomas Hudson and Allan Ramsay.  Wollaston's work often imitates theirs.In 1749 Wollaston went to New York City, where he introduced London's fashionable styles in portraiture to American patrons.Wollaston remained in the colonies for eighteen years.  His style of portraiture featured rich fabrics, graceful poses, and smiling faces with upturned lips and oval eyes.  He painted almost fifty New York portraits of merchants and landowners, and the images are very similar to the work of English painters in pose, attributes, color and the use of landscape backgrounds.In 1752 Wollaston went south, visiting Philadelphia briefly before arriving in Annapolis by the spring of 1753.  In the next year or two he painted about sixty portraits of Maryland sitters.  He then moved on to Virginia where between 1755 and 1757 he painted as many portraits, continuing to use compositions that he had learned in London, which by the mid-1750's were less fashionable but still impressive.  He returned to Philadelphia by the fall of 1758 and was last recorded there in May 1759. He may have gone to the West Indies before his arrival in Charleston in September 1765, where he painted at least seventeen portraits before returning to London in May 1767.  These late works show figures on a smaller scale than the monumental, formal 50-by-40-inch sizes preferred in Maryland and Virginia.  Except for a chance encounter in England in 1775 with an acquaintance from the Leeward Islands, nothing is known of Wollaston after 1767.Wollaston was a competent but not very inventive painter who produced more than two hundred portraits in the colonies, almost as many as John Singleton Copley in the same number of years.  He travelled more widely in the colonies than any other painter, satisfying the growing demand for formal portraiture for the new homes of the members of the merchant and landowning classes.   His work was praised in poetry published in the Maryland Gazette in 1753 and in The American Magazine and Monthly Chronicle for the British Colonies (Philadelphia, Vol. 1, no. 12, September 1758: 607-608).  Wollaston's impact on younger artists was especially felt in Philadelphia, where Robert Feke, John Hesselius and West all imitated his technique and compositions in their own work.[This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "The painter Robert Feke was born c. 1707, the second son of Robert Feke, an Oyster Bay, New York Baptist minister and blacksmith.  His birth and death dates have never been determined, but are deduced from references to him and his family in contemporary documents.  Feke worked as a surveyor in Oyster Bay from 1725 to 1730.  It is believed that he learned the techniques of painting in the 1730's in New York City.  His earliest documented portrait is the ambitious group of The Isaac Royall Family (1741; Harvard University Law School), which may have been painted in Rhode Island.  The following year Feke married Eleanor Cozzens, daughter of Newport's most prominent tailor, Leonard Cozzens.  He settled in Newport, where he painted portraits for the next four years.  Dr. Alexander Hamilton of Annapolis visited his studio in 1744 and described Feke as \"the most extraordinary genius I ever knew, for he does pictures tollerably well by the force of genius, having never had any teaching.\"  He wrote that Feke was a man with \"exactly the phizz of a painter, having a long pale face, sharp nose, large eyes with which he looked upon you stedfastly, long curled black hair, a delicate white hand, and long fingers.\"  This description closely matches the image in the self-portrait that Feke painted at about this time (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston).Feke went to Philadelphia in 1746 to paint portraits, probably at the suggestion of John Wallace, who had moved there from Newport.  He made a similar painting trip from Newport to Boston in 1748, where he painted some of his best known work, including portraits of members of the Bowdoin family and a full-length of Samuel Waldo (Bowdoin College).  His work rapidly became more accomplished, his steady improvement particularly noticeable in his decorative renderings of the fabrics of his sitters' clothes.  On a second trip to Philadelphia in 1749-1750 Feke had a number of commissions for portraits from members of the Philadelphia Dancing Assembly that was established by Wallace and others the previous year.  Feke's promising career ended abruptly at about this time.  The last record of the artist is his attendance at his brother-in-law's wedding in Newport on 26 August 1751.  Although he may have gone to Barbardos, where members of the Feke family lived, no record of his activity or death there has been found.

    "biography": "Born in Boston in 1727, John Greenwood began his artistic career in 1742 as an apprentice to Thomas Johnston, who taught him to engrave bookplates and heraldic devices.  He began painting portraits by 1747.  The approximately fifty paintings that he made in the Boston area during the next five years represent formally posed sitters in attitudes and settings reminiscent of the work of English painter John Smibert, who had settled in Boston in 1730.  The colors of some of Greenwood's portraits suggest that he also knew the work of Robert Feke.Greenwood's later work has not been fully studied.  He left Boston in 1752 for the Dutch colony of Surinam, in South America, where he painted 115 portraits of residents and of the New England sea captains who visited the port.  He recorded these in a memorandum book (New-York Historical Society).  None of his work from these years is located today (1993), with the exception of Sea Captains Carousing at Surinam (c. 1758; The Saint Louis Art Museum), which reveals in its lampooning content the direct influence of William Hogarth's engraving, A Midnight Modern Conversation.  In 1758 Greenwood went to Amsterdam, where he worked as a portrait painter and engraver for five years and also became an auctioneer and dealer.  In the 1760's he settled in London, where he became a member of the Society of Artists of Great Britain and exhibited at the members' annual exhibition from 1764 to 1776.  In 1770, realizing that he would not return to America, he commissioned John Singleton Copley to paint a portrait of his mother, Mrs. Humphrey Devereux (National Gallery of Art, Wellington, New Zealand), one of Copley's most sympathetic portraits.  Greenwood became a successful dealer and auctioneer and spent the rest of his life in London.  He died in Margate, England, in 1792.

    "biography": "François Boucher was a member of an extraordinarily talented generation of artists born around 1700 who would dominate French painting for much of the eighteenth century.[1] Heir to the grand manner of seventeenth-century art, Boucher nevertheless created a style and repertory of subject matter that was perfectly compatible with the intimate scale and refined taste of the court of Louis XV (r. 1715-1774) and his maitresse en titre, the marquise de Pompadour (1721-1764). Lavishly patronized and showered with academic honors throughout his career, Boucher came under harsh criticism later in his life, when his ebullient rococo style was attacked as decorative and his gallant iconography condemned as trivial.      A native of Paris, Boucher learned the rudiments of painting from his father, Nicolas (1672-1743), a member of the Académie de Saint-Luc. In the early 1720s he studied for a short time with François Lemoyne (1688-1737), one of the leading historical painters of the day, who would later be appointed First Painter to the King. According to Boucher, this experience did not have a great effect on his art,[2] even if several early paintings bear the influence of Lemoyne (for example, The Surprise, c. 1723-1725, New Orleans Museum of Art).      Boucher won the Grand Prix in 1723, but there was no room for him at the French Academy in Rome, so his trip to Italy was delayed several years. He spent the intervening period painting (he exhibited several works at the annual Exposition de la Jeunesse in the Place Dauphine in 1725) and printmaking, which he learned while living in the household of the engraver Jean François Cars (1661-1730). This experience led him to the print publisher Jean de Jullienne (1686-1766), for whom he produced numerous etchings for the Recueil Jullienne, a multivolume compendium of prints after compositions by Jean Antoine Watteau (1684-1721). As a result, Boucher gained what amounted to a second education as he immersed himself in the visual language and imagery of the great master of the fête galante. He finally traveled to Italy in 1728 at his own expense, although next to nothing is known about his activities there or whether the trip had any effect on his art. He was back in Paris by 1731. That same year he was admitted as a history painter into the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture, gaining full membership three years later with Rinaldo and Armida (Paris, Musée du Louvre), a painting that still demonstrates the influence of Lemoyne.      From these auspicious beginnings followed an exceptionally successful career, as Boucher won a succession of important commissions from the French Crown and aristocracy. For Louis XV he produced many painted decorations for royal châteaus at Versailles, Bellevue, Choisy, and Fontainebleau while also participating in the decoration of aristocratic residences in Paris, such as the Hôtel de Soubise. Among his most innovative works were two pictures of exotic hunts, La Chasse au Tigre and La Chasse au Crocodile, painted for the king's private apartments at Versailles and now in the Musée de Picardie, Amiens. His prodigious oeuvre and the many engravings made after his works soon earned him an international reputation.[3] With Charles Joseph Natoire (1700-1777) and Carle Van Loo (1705-1765) he was one of the principal exponents of the rococo, the ornate, colorful style of art associated with the reign of Louis XV. A tireless draftsman, Boucher made lyrical and often brilliant drawings that were widely collected, then as now, and disseminated through prints by such artists as Gilles Demarteau (1722-1776), who perfected a \"crayon-manner\" engraving technique that reproduced the soft textures of colored chalk.      Boucher is perhaps best known for his many mythological paintings, such as Diana at the Bath of 1742 (Paris, Musée du Louvre), and pastoral subjects, such as Pensent-ils au Raisin of 1749 (London, Wallace Collection). Generally idealized and lighthearted depictions of rustic life, these pastorals sometimes drew their imagery from the theater, such as the comic operas of Charles Simon Favart (1710-1792) and Jean Monnet (1703-1785), for whom Boucher designed stage sets in the 1740s and 1750s. A diverse artist, Boucher also produced religious paintings, some of them innovative, such as his devotional picture La Lumière du monde of 1750 (Lyon, Musée des Beaux-Arts), painted for Madame de Pompadour's private chapel at Bellevue; genre scenes (his Le Déjeuner of 1739 in the Musée du Louvre is one of his highest achievements in the category of the tableau de mode); landscapes; and portraits. This latter category, encountered infrequently in his oeuvre, nevertheless includes one of his greatest masterpieces, the monumental Portrait of Madame de Pompadour of 1756 (Munich, Alte Pinakothek).[4]      In addition to his many painted decorations and cabinet pictures, Boucher contributed designs for the Beauvais and Gobelins tapestry works, the Sèvres porcelain factory, and stage sets and costumes for the theater. He also produced numerous chinoiseries, fanciful and exotic images of the Far East (such as the oil sketches, now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Besançon, used as tapestry designs).[5] He was the favorite artist of Madame de Pompadour, for whom he painted some of his most impressive works, including The Rising of the Sun and The Setting of the Sun of 1753 (London, Wallace Collection), large canvases that were made as tapestry cartoons for Beauvais. Boucher's flourishing studio was the training ground for many young artists, the greatest of whom, Jean Honoré Fragonard (1732-1806), would surpass his master in invention and ingenuity if not in public renown. During the 1750s and 1760s Boucher's increasingly saccharine style and repetitive compositions came under attack from anti-rococo critics like Etienne La Font de Saint-Yenne (1688-1771) and Denis Diderot (1713-1784), who saw Boucher's lighthearted subject matter and fluid, coloristic style as frivolous and morally corrupt. Yet Boucher, in defiance of an increasing demand from theorists, critics, and public agitators, continued to exhibit his cheerful and sugary visions of pastoral bliss and mythological trysts at the biennial Salons. Indeed, his social connections and efficient careerism resulted in his appointment in 1765 as First Painter to the King and his election as director of the Académie royale. This final triumph was short lived, however, as Boucher died in Paris in 1770.[1] For a list of these artists, see Pierre Rosenberg, in Alistair Laing, François Boucher (1703-1770), Exh. cat., Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Detroit Institute of Arts; Galeries nationales du Grand Palais, Paris, 1986-1987: 51.[2] Pierre Jean Mariette, Abecedario de P.J.

    "biography": "Fragonard was one of the most prolific of the eighteenth-century painters and draftsmen. Born in 1732 in Grasse in southern France, he moved with his family at an early age to Paris. He first took a position as a clerk, but having demonstrated an interest in art, he worked in the studio of the still life and genre painter Jean Siméon Chardin (1699-1779). After spending a short time with Chardin, from whom he probably learned merely the bare rudiments of his craft, he entered the studio of François Boucher (1703-1770). Under Boucher's tutelage Fragonard's talent developed rapidly, and he was soon painting decorative pictures and pastoral subjects very close to his master's style (for example, Diana and Endymion, NGA 1960.6.2). Although Fragonard apparently never took courses at the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture, he entered the Prix de Rome competition in 1752, sponsored by Boucher, winning the coveted first prize on the strength of Jeroboam Sacrificing to the Idols (Paris, École des Beaux-Arts). Before leaving for Italy, however, he entered the École des élèves protégés in Paris, a school established to train the most promising students of the Académie royale. There he studied history and the classics and worked with the director, Carle Van Loo (1705-1765), one of the leading painters of the day. Van Loo's influence on Fragonard's art is evident in the large Psyche Showing Her Sisters the Gifts She Has Received from Cupid (London, National Gallery), a fluidly painted work that was exhibited to King Louis XV (r. 1715-1774) in 1754.      Following his stint at the École, Fragonard traveled to Italy, spending the years 1756-1761 at the Académie de France in Rome. Fragonard's slow progress (or his unwillingness to complete his assigned artistic chores) concerned the director, Charles Joseph Natoire (1700-1777), but the young artist showed greater promise when he was steered toward sketching in the open air, a practice that Natoire encouraged. Inspired by such landscapists active in Italy as Hubert Robert (1733-1808) and Claude Joseph Vernet (1714-1789) and by the patronage of the Abbé de Saint-Non (1727-1791), an accomplished amateur and avid collector, Fragonard developed an interest in landscape painting and drawing that would remain an important aspect of his art throughout his life. During the summer of 1760, spent with Saint-Non at the Villa d'Este in Tivoli, Fragonard produced a series of red chalk drawings of the gardens and principal sites of the town that are among the greatest examples of landscape art of the century. He returned to France in the company of Saint-Non, with whom he had traveled extensively through Italy, making drawings of the principal architectural sites and works of art that they encountered. Saint-Non later used these drawings as the basis for a series of etchings and aquatints.      Back in Paris, Fragonard painted small cabinet pictures--primarily landscapes and genre scenes--for the art market and a growing group of admirers. He made his public debut at the Salon of 1765 with the stunning Corésus and Callirhoé (Paris, Musée du Louvre), a monumental canvas that seemed to herald his arrival as the most promising history painter of his generation. The grand machine won him probationary acceptance into the Académie and the accolades of the critic Denis Diderot (1713-1784), who discussed the picture at length in his Salon review in the Correspondance littéraire. Despite this early success, Fragonard declined to pursue a public career as a history painter, preferring to work for a private clientele of financiers and courtiers. The failure of the crown to reimburse him promptly for the Corésus may have been a factor in his decision. As a result, little documentation and critical commentary concerning Fragonard's art survives, and only recently has the development of his career, his patrons, and the significance of his innovative imagery begun to be fully explored, notably in the exhibition held in Paris and New York in 1987-1988.      Nevertheless, Fragonard is rightly considered among the most characteristic and important French painters of the second half of the eighteenth century. Over four decades, he produced many brilliantly realized easel paintings, like The Swing (London, Wallace Collection), commissioned in 1767, or the Portraits de fantaisie (Paris, Musée du Louvre, and elsewhere), painted in the late 1760s and early 1770s; and large-scale decorative works, the most significant extant example being the four magisterial canvases known as the Progress of Love (1771-1772; New York, Frick Collection), commissioned by Madame du Barry (1743-1793) for her country retreat at Louveciennes. These paintings marked Fragonard as among the most innovative and brilliant painters of the day, yet his apparently whimsical temperament and independent ways meant that he never realized the conventional rewards his talent deserved. The Louveciennes paintings were returned to the artist, replaced by drier yet more currently neoclassical compositions by Joseph Marie Vien (1716-1809) (Paris, Musée du Louvre, and Paris, Château de Chambéry), and other commissions were left incomplete. Yet Fragonard earned a good living selling paintings to a close-knit group of collectors, many of them drawn from the ranks of the fermiers généraux (tax farmers), and by providing brilliant wash drawings as illustrations for various luxurious book publishing projects.      A second trip to Italy in 1773-1774 in the company of the financier Pierre Jacques Onésyme Bergeret de Grancourt (1715-1785), one of the artist's major patrons, rekindled Fragonard's interest in landscape and garden imagery, leading to such masterpieces as theFête at Saint-Cloud (Paris, Banque de France) and the pendants Blindman's Buff and The Swing (NGA 1961.9.16 and 1961.9.17), datable to the late 1770s. During these years Fragonard also produced numerous ink and wash drawings whose broad handling and vivid luminosity reflect an ever-increasing self-assurance and technical command. Always a changeable artist, he simultaneously painted tightly wrought cabinet pictures in an erotic vein, the most celebrated example being The Bolt (c. 1777-1778; Paris, Musée du Louvre), made popular through engravings. Such late works--highly finished pictures focusing on intimate themes--show a fascination with the goût hollandais, an influence he passed on to his only true student, his sister-in-law Marguerite Gérard (1761-1837), with whom he sometimes collaborated. Certain of Fragonard's later paintings, like The Invocation to Love, known in numerous versions, also demonstrate a darker, more emotional character that anticipates romanticism. During the revolution Fragonard left Paris for his native Grasse, taking with him The Progress of Love cycle, which he reassembled in the house of his cousin. In 1793 he returned to Paris, where his old acquaintance Jacques Louis David (1748-1845) appointed him a curator at the new national museum. During the last decade of his life his artistic production lessened, perhaps in the recognition that his late rococo style was out of step with the times. He died in 1806.[Richard Rand, in French Paintings of the Fifteenth through the Eighteenth Century, The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue, Washington, D.C., 2009: 149-150.]",

    "biography": "American-born Benjamin West was one of the most prominent artists in late eighteenth century London.  President of the Royal Academy from 1792 until his death, he received many commissions from George III and other English patrons, and at the same time served as teacher and advisor to three generations of American artists in London.  He was born in Springfield, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia, on October 10, 1738.  His earliest paintings were portraits of children, Robert and Jane Morris (c. 1752; Chester County Historical Society, West Chester, Pennsylvania).  His exceptional talent was quickly recognized, and he painted portraits in eastern Pennsylvania and New York City (briefly), influenced by the work of John Valentine Haidt, William Williams, and John Wollaston.  He went to Italy in 1760 to continue his study of painting and after three years, spent primarily in Rome, Florence, and Venice, he settled in London.West worked primarily as a painter of historical and religious subjects, and as a portrait painter as patronage required.  The first pictures he exhibited in London at the Society of Artists in 1764 were subjects from Renaissance literature, and within a few years he painted several classical subjects.  George III then commissioned The Departure of Regulus from Rome (1769; Queen Elizabeth II), marking the beginning of royal patronage of West, who painted some sixty pictures for the King between then and 1801.West is best known for his influential history painting, The Death of General Wolfe (1770; National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa), exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1771.  A milestone in English and American art, this was the first major depiction of a contemporary event with figures in modern clothing.  Its subject matter was the heroic death of an English general in battle against the French in Canada.  Two later paintings with American subjects were Penn's Treaty with the Indians (1771-1772; Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia) and the unfinished Signing of the Preliminary Treaty of Peace in 1782 (1783-84; Henry Francis Du Pont Winterthur Museum, Winterthur, Delaware).In the 1770's West subject matter began to include the religious themes that dominated his work of the late 1770's and 1780's.  Most notable were his paintings on the progress of Revealed Religion for the Royal Chapel and designs for stained glass for St. Georges Chapel, both at Windsor Castle.  Other commissions for Windsor included family portraits and eight paintings from English history for the Audience Chamber.   As George III withdrew his support in the 1790s, William Beckford became an important patron, and commissioned religious paintings and portraits for his Gothic Revival country house, Fonthill Abbey.  West died in London in 1820.West during most of his career painted complex multifigure compositions and employed sophisticated glazing techniques that differed dramatically from the painting methods he had learned in Pennsylvania.  The extraordinary stylistic and compositional differences between West's American and English work are due very much to his three years of study in Italy, when he absorbed the painting styles and compositions of Italian Renaissance and baroque painters, as well as those of his contemporaries. Later, as West became a pivotal figure in educating American-born artists in England, this knowledge in turn transformed the work of his pupils.  Americans who studied with West before and during the Revolution included Matthew Pratt, Charles Willson Peale, and Gilbert Stuart.  Among his students in the 1780s were Ralph Earl and John Trumbull.  These and later Americans, including Washington Allston and Thomas Sully, brought West's ideas and techniques back to the United States, providing a foundation for the growth of the arts in America in the Federal period and creating a late eighteenth and early nineteenth century American style of considerable sophistication.

    "biography": "Devis was born in Preston, Lancashire, on 12 February 1712, the eldest son of Anthony Devis and Ellen Rauthmell.  Perhaps through the influence of the Liverpool portrait painter Hamlet Winstanley he became the pupil in London of the sporting and topographical painter Peter Tillemans.  After the latter's retirement in 1733 he returned to Preston, and his earliest dated work, of 1735, is a view painting.  His earliest dated portraits are from 1741, and by the following year he is recorded as working in London.  In that year he married Elizabeth Faulkner; the couple had twenty-two children.  In 1745, well established as a painter of small-scale portraits and conversation pieces, he settled on Great Queen Street in Lincoln's Inn Fields. Many of his early commissions came from Lancashire Jacobite families, and were obtained through his father's local connections.  In 1752 he took on an apprentice, George Senhouse, but was obliged to discharge him after three years for idleness; he had at least three other students.From 1761 Devis exhibited irregularly at the Free Society of Artists, of which he became president in 1768.  In this decade, however, his reputation was eclipsed by that of Zoffany.  Devis never exhibited at the Society of Artists or the Royal Academy of Arts and never competed for Associateship of the latter body.In later life Devis was active more as a restorer; between 1777 and 1778 he was paid one thousand pounds for cleaning and repairing the Painted Hall at Greenwich.  In 1783 he sold his collection of pictures and retired to Brighton, where he died on 25 July 1787.

    "biography": "François-Hubert Drouais belonged to a dynasty of French painters that included his father, Hubert Drouais (1699-1767), and his son, Jean Germain (1763-1788). François-Hubert was born in Paris on December 14, 1727. During his relatively short career, he established himself as one of the leading portrait painters of the age of Louis XV. He is presumed to have studied at various times with Donat Nonotte (1708-1785), Carle Van Loo (1705-1765), Charles Joseph Natoire (1700-1777), and François Boucher (1703-1770). He mastered the rules governing portrait painting in the ultra-refined society of mid-eighteenth-century Paris and Versailles.      By the late 1750s, when he presented his candidacy for membership in the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture, he had become the chief rival of Jean- Marc Nattier (1685-1766), whom he would eventually succeed as portraitist to the royal family, Louis XV's last two official mistresses, and members of the nobility and the high-ranking bourgeoisie. Unlike Nattier, however, he made only infrequent use of the mythological and allegorical trappings of history painting. Graceful poses, sumptuous costumes, richly decorated interiors, or lush garden settings are distinctive features of his best works, and a brilliant technique enhances their allure.      It became very fashionable in the Paris of the late 1750s and the 1760s to have one's portrait painted by François-Hubert Drouais. His art epitomizes the rococo at the moment of its decline. The full-length portrait of Madame de Pompadour (1721-1764) (London, National Gallery), which he finished in 1764 after the sitter's death, is a virtuoso performance of extraordinary elegance. He was also perfectly capable of capturing the inner life of his subjects. The two diploma pieces he presented to the Académie on his election in 1758--portraits of the sculptors Edme Bouchardon and Guillaume Coustou (Musée des Châteaux de Versailles et de Trianon), his handsome likeness of his wife Anne Marie Françoise Doré (Paris, Musée du Louvre) of c. 1758, and his bust-length portrait of Louis XV (Versailles) of 1773--are all refreshingly sober images. Drouais' success at court continued after Louis XVI's accession to the throne in 1774, but he died shortly thereafter on October 21, 1775, at the age of forty-eight. He had been a regular exhibitor at the Salon, where his works were judged, often harshly, by such critics as Denis Diderot (1713-1784).      Drouais' son, Jean Germain, became Jacques Louis David's (1748-1825) most promising pupil and assisted the master in the execution of The Oath of the Horatii  (Paris, Musée du Louvre). Unfortunately, the young prodigy died prematurely in Rome.[Joseph Baillio, in The French Paintings of the Fifteenth through the Eighteenth Century, The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue, Washington, D.C., 2009: 135.]",

    "biography": "John Singleton Copley was born in Boston in 1738, and grew up there, training in the visual arts under his step-father Peter Pelham (c. 1697-1751), an English engraver who had immigrated in 1727 and married Copley's widowed mother in 1748.  Copley's earliest paintings, from the mid-1750s, reveal the influence of English mezzotint portraits as well as the work of local and itinerant artists.  He experimented with many media: oil on canvas, miniatures on copper or ivory, pastel, and printmaking.  By the late 1750s he was established as a portrait painter.Copley worked in Boston until 1774 with the exception of a six month painting trip to New York City in 1771.  By the mid-1760s he wanted to compare his works with those by contemporaries in England, and in 1765 he sent a portrait of his half-brother Henry Pelham, Boy with a Squirrel, to the annual exhibition of the Society of Artists of Great Britain.  Encouraged by Benjamin West and Joshua Reynolds, Copley left Boston for study in Europe.  He left for London in 1774 and went almost immediately to Italy, where he spent more than a year, studying and painting.  He returned to London in 1775, settling there with his wife and three of his children, who had come from Boston.1776 marked the beginning of the second half of Copley's career.  As his first work at the Royal Academy he exhibited The Copley Family, painted in 1777, followed by Watson and the Shark the next year.  The success of these paintings brought him the praise of reviewers and earned him full membership in the academy.  His ambition was to paint large history paintings of contemporary events, like those of Benjamin West, and he exhibited independently, charging admission, The Death of the Earl of Chatham (Tate Gallery), The Death of Major Pierson (Tate Gallery), and the Siege of Gibraltar (Guildhall Art Gallery, London).  He also continued to paint portraits, many on a much larger scale than his American work.  Copley died in London in 1815.

    "biography": "Nothing is known about English portrait painter Joseph Blackburn prior to his presence on Bermuda in 1752.  During an extended stay on the island he painted about twenty-five portraits, including those of members of the Jones, Tucker and Harvey families.  His compositions show that he was familiar with the work of the leading London portrait painters of the 1740's, including Thomas Hudson and Allan Ramsay.  His rather dry, precise technique suggests a provincial English training.   After about a year, Blackburn went from Bermuda to Newport, Rhode Island, where he painted several members of the Cheseborough family.  He also painted Mr. and Mrs. John Brown (private collection), whose son-in-law Thomas Vernon introduced Blackburn to James Boutineau of Boston, describing him in his letter of November 25, 1754 as \"late from the Island of Bermuda a Limner by profession & is allow'd to excell in that science, has now spent some months in this place, & behav'd in all respects as becomes a Gentleman, being possess'd with the agreeable qualities of great modesty, good sence & genteel behaviour.\"Blackburn's graceful poses, his precise treatment of lace and other clothing details, and his softly colored landscape settings won him numerous commissions in the Boston area during the next five years.  He repeated popular English poses: merchants at their desks, military men in uniform, public officials in their robes of office; women as shepherdesses or in dresses with low-cut bodices, decorated with lace, ribbon, jewels and flowing scarves.  He apparently made contact with his sitters by personal recommendation; no newspaper advertisements have been found.In 1759-61 Blackburn worked in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where he painted several portraits for the Wentworths, as well as members of the Warner family.  Portraits of Bostonians dated 1760, and a newspaper notice in 1761 regarding an unclaimed letter, suggest that he went back and forth between the two cities.  He may also have returned to Rhode Island: one portrait of a member of the Babcock family of Westerly is dated 1761.Blackburn returned to England by January 1764 and painted portraits in southwestern English counties of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Monmouthshire, as well as in Dublin.  His last known portrait is of Hugh Jones, agent to the Morgan family of Tregdegar Park, Newport, Monmouthshire (1777; Worcester Art Museum, Mass.).  Blackburn is particularly important in the history of American art for his early influence on John Singleton Copley.  About one hundred and fifty portraits are signed by or attributed to him.[This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "Reynolds was born in Plympton in Devonshire on 16 July 1723, seventh child in the large family of the Reverend Samuel Reynolds and Theophilia Potter.  Inspired to become an artist by Jonathan Richardson's elevated Essay on the Theory of Painting, Reynolds was apprenticed in 1740 to Thomas Hudson, the most fashionable portraitist of the day, with whom he remained until 1743.After two years of independent practice in London and another two in his native Devonshire, Reynolds was introduced by his father's friend Lord Edgcumbe to Commodore Augustus Keppel, about to sail to the Mediterranean, who invited him to join his expedition.  After a stay in Minorca he spent over two years in Rome, from 1750 to 1752, returning through Florence, Venice and northern Italy, Lyons, and Paris.  He brought back with him Giuseppe Marchi, whom he employed as an assistant until the end of his life.  Although he never received any academic training, this experience of Italy, his reverence for Raphael, Michelangelo, and the Venetians, and the notebooks that he filled with drawings from classical antiquity and from the Old Masters were the foundation of his ideals and practice as a painter.Armed with introductions from Lord Edgcumbe to aristocratic sitters, and immediately establishing his reputation in London with his masterly and dramatic full length portrait of Keppel in the pose of the Apollo Belvedere, Reynolds soon supplanted Hudson as the capital's leading portraitist, his only serious competitor being Ramsay.  In 1759 he had more than 150 sitters; the following year he bought a grand house on Leicester Fields, took on pupils, and ran a coach.  He never married; his household was run first by his sister Frances, then by his niece, Mary Palmer.The press of business was so great, especially in the middle years of his career, that, as had been customary with a busy portraitist since the time of Lely, the drapery and subordinate parts of his portraits were usually largely executed by assistants--at first by Peter Toms, and later by his own pupils.  He employed the finest engravers to publish his principal compositions in mezzotint, a medium in which British eighteenth-century printmakers excelled.  He also contributed regularly to the exhibitions first of the Society of Artists, then of the Royal Academy.  Though he was uninterested in politics and no courtier, his eminence was such that it was inevitably he who was appointed first president of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1768. He was then knighted.In 1781 Reynolds visited Flanders and Holland, where he was greatly impressed by the work of Rubens.  In 1784 he was appointed principal portrait painter to the king in succession to Ramsay.  The following year he was commissioned by Catherine II of Russia to paint an historical picture of his own choosing; The Infant Hercules was his largest and most ambitious work.  Apart from experiencing chronic deafness he had always enjoyed vigorous good health until he suffered a stroke in 1782; in 1789 he lost the sight of his left eye, and on 23 February 1792 he died in his home on Leicester Fields.  He was given a quasi-state funeral and was buried in Saint Paul's Cathedral.  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "Jean Baptiste Greuze was born in Tournus in 1725, sixth son of a master tiler. Legend has it that the young Greuze convinced his father of his natural aptitude for painting when he showed him a pen-and-ink drawing of Saint James, which his father mistook for an engraving. Greuze was sent to Lyon to study with the commercially successful portrait painter Charles Grandon (1691-1762). Sometime before 1755, Greuze left Lyon for Paris, where he went to pursue his studies at the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture.      Very little is known of Greuze's early years in Paris. At first, he studied drawing at the Académie under Charles Joseph Natoire (1700-1777), although this master of the rococo style seems to have had little effect on Greuze's stylistic development. Greuze's earliest support came from two established academicians-Louis de Silvestre (1675-1760, named director of the Académie in 1752) and the sculptor Jean Baptiste Pigalle (1714-1785). The story of his successful acceptance to the ranks of the Académie foreshadows the painter's later defiance of academic protocol. Disgruntled by his disadvantageous placement in the drawing studio, Greuze demanded a better seat, even though he had not participated in the competitions by which the hierarchy of placement was normally determined. He was challenged to present an array of his works for evaluation. Silvestre, by then the director, found Greuze's offering so perfect that he was accepted on the spot and named associate member on June 28, 1755. That same year, Greuze's first Salon success included A Father Reading the Bible to His Family (France, private collection), The Blindman Deceived (Moscow, State Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts), A Child, Who Has Fallen Asleep on Top of His Book (Montpellier, Musée Fabre), and Portrait of Louis de Silvestre (Munich, Alte Pinakothek).      Through Pigalle, Greuze was introduced to Louis Gougenot, abbé de Chezal-Benôit (1719-1767), who would be rewarded with the title of honorary associate for his efforts to promote the young artist. From 1755 to 1757 Greuze traveled throughout Italy in the company of Gougenot. In Rome, he was given the privilege of lodgings in the Palazzo Mancini (seat of the Académie de France) through the goodwill of the marquis de Marigny (1727-1781) and Natoire, now director of the Académie de France. On his return to Paris, Greuze's popularity continued to grow with each Salon. One of his most celebrated works was The Marriage Contract (Paris, Musée du Louvre), exhibited at the Salon of 1761 and bought by the marquis de Marigny, a picture whose universal appeal assured Greuze's celebrity as the eighteenth-century innovator of paintings of sensibilité.      In 1767 the Académie royale admonished Greuze for failing to supply his long-awaited morceau de réception. Two years later he submitted Septimius Severus and Caracalla (Paris, Musée du Louvre) in an attempt to be accepted into the Académie in the esteemed category of history painting. He failed, however, and the ensuing fracas between the indignant Greuze and his unsympathetic colleagues over the rejection of this highly experimental attempt at Poussinesque history painting forever soured the painter's relationship with the Académie under the ancien régime. At about this time, Greuze's relationship with such influential supporters as Denis Diderot (1713-1784) and Pigalle also began to erode. Thereafter, Greuze refused to exhibit at the Salon, choosing instead to give private showings of his work at his studio during the season of the Salon.      Despite Greuze's difficulty with the Académie, his career continued to flourish. He could boast such high-placed patrons as Ange Laurent de La Live de Jully (1725-1779), the Empress Catherine II of Russia (r. 1762-1796), and the marquise de Pompadour (1721-1764). His defiance of the Académie did more than a little to enhance his reputation as rebellious genius, which, as a marketing tactic, served him well. A failure more damaging to the course of Greuze's career than his rejected morceau de réception was his marriage. In 1759, at the brink of his blossoming career, Greuze married Anne Marie Babuty, the daughter of a bookseller. Madame Greuze would prove to be a vindictive and treacherous partner. Her affairs with Greuze's sitters and students caused him both humiliation and loss of income. Their stormy marriage was legally dissolved in 1793, with Madame Greuze receiving a substantial settlement.      When in 1800 Greuze decided to exhibit his work once again at the Parisian Salon, his star had long begun to fade. Younger imitators such as his former pupil Pierre Alexandre Wille (1748-1821) and Nicolas Bernard Lépicié (1705-1784) had replaced Greuze in the eyes of the public as painters of sensibilité. In 1781 Jacques Louis David (1748-1825) had superseded Greuze's failed hybrid of genre and Poussinesque history painting with a more powerful version of his own, when he exhibited his Belisarius (Lille, Musée des Beaux-Arts) to critical acclaim. By the last decade of Greuze's life, taste had shifted definitively toward the neoclassical idiom. Financial mismanagement, the fall of the ancien régime, and a costly divorce left him nearly destitute. To survive, he turned to the kind of saccharine têtes de jeunes filles that have ever since tarnished his posthumous critical fortune. Tragically, on his death in 1805 at the age of eighty, the painter who had commanded some of the highest prices in France and abroad during the 1760s and 1770s was nearly penniless.[Philip Conisbee, in French Paintings of the Fifteenth through the Eighteenth Century, The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue, Washington, D.C., 2009: 246.]",

    "biography": "Francesco Guardi was born in Venice in 1712.  Due to a lack of documentation and secure early works, his initial training and career remain the subject of intense speculation.  It cannot be assumed that he was trained by his elder brother Antonio (1699-1761), who was too young to have inherited the family workshop upon the death of their father Domenico (1678-1716).  Furthermore, the obvious differences in the brothers' styles go beyond a difference in temperament and indicate that Francesco was probably trained by another master.  Yet, suggestions that he received this initial training in the family's native Trentino, in Vienna with a north-Italian painter, or in Venice remain highly speculative.By about 1730 a Guardi family workshop was in existence in Venice: a will of 1731 refers to copies by the \"fratelli Guardi.\"  Because Francesco would have been only 18 at this time, it can be assumed that at first Antonio probably functioned as the head of the shop. It appears, however, that Francesco soon collaborated on and made independent contributions, primarily as a figure painter, to the shop's large projects.  He also accepted independent commissions, as clearly indicated by two letters of 1750 in which he attempted to recover payment on sketches for unexecuted figure compositions. After Antonio's death in 1761, Francesco continued to work occasionally as a figure painter, but was active mainly as a painter of views and capricci.Francesco's activity as a view painter probably grew out of the Guardi family practice of copying the works of other artists rather than from any formal training with another master and appears to have begun in the early to mid-1750s: none of his views can be dated before about 1754 based on topographical details.  Francesco's earliest views, such as those in the collection of the  Duke of Buccleuch, employ a style derived primarily from that of the mature Canaletto (1697-1768) and also Michele Marieschi (1710-1743).  Francesco often borrowed entire compositions from paintings and prints by both artists, although he increasingly worked from his own drawings.  The earliest view to bear both Francesco's signature and a date, 1758, is a Mardi Gras in the Piazzetta (Sotheby Parke Bernet, New York, 11 January 1990, no. 121).  In comparison to the earlier views, this work shows a darkening and softening of Canaletto's cool hardness with atmospheric effects, reminiscent of Luca Carlevarijs (1663-1730), and looks forward to Francesco's style of the 1760s.Like other view painters, Francesco also painted depictions of Venetian festivities and the architectural and landscape capricci so popular in the eighteenth century.  Depictions of festivities, such as the Mardi Gras of 1758, and of events connected with the visits of foreign dignitaries are known from throughout Francesco's career.  His first capricci, however, cannot be dated before the early 1760s on stylistic grounds.  Like his first views, these capricci are derived from those of other artists, in this case Marco Ricci (1676-1729) and Luca Carlevarijs, and often adopt whole compositions or specific ruin and landscape elements from them.After about 1770 Francesco's chronology becomes slightly more secure, and in the 1780's can be established around several documented commissions.  In the 1770s, Francesco's brushwork became increasingly loose and fractured, and was combined with a softer, increasingly cool palette and subtle effects of changeant color that create a shimmering atmospheric veil across the surface of now smaller canvases.  He also began to modify both the relative proportions of buildings and the perspectival recession for expressive effect.  In his last years (c. 1780-1793) these developments continued, with still looser brushwork, more expressive manipulation of perspective, and renewed interest in chiaroscuro effects.  During these years Francesco's son Giacomo (1764-1835) assumed a growing role in the production of views and capricci.  After Francesco's death in Venice in 1793, Giacomo continued to produce paintings of inferior quality, which he often sold as his father's with false or ambiguous signatures.Francesco's extremely prolific output seems to have been purchased mainly by middle-class Venetians and English visitors of modest means.  Their recorded statements show an appreciation for Francesco's painterly brio and poetic vision, while others criticized these same qualities as poor technique and carelessness in the depiction of specific sites.

    "biography": "Pietro Antonio Rotari was born in Verona on September 30, 1707, the son of a distinguished local physician and scientist.  He received drawing lessons as a child from the Flemish engraver, Robert Van Auden-Aerdt, and from an early age produced etchings, mostly of sacred themes.  He was apprenticed to the Veronese painter Antonio Balestra, who greatly influenced his early style of history painting, from 1723 to 1725.  In 1726 he travelled to Venice to study the city's old master and contemporary paintings, in particular the works of Piazzetta (1683-1754) and Tiepolo (1696-1770).  From 1727 to 1731 Rotari lived in Rome under the aegis of a Veronese canon, Francesco Biancolini, and studied with Francesco Trevisani (1656-1746). Rotari's local reputation was established when a painting of his was sent from Rome to the Accademia Filarmonica in Verona in 1728 and was praised by the noted scholar and author, Francesco Scipione Maffei.  He interrupted his Roman sojourn in 1729 to visit Naples, where he studied the works of Francesco Solimena and other artists attached to the Bourbon court of Ferdinand IV.  In 1734 he returned to his native Verona, and in the following year opened a private academy of painting.Rotari forged these eclectic influences into a style that brought him modest success with commissions for churches and palaces in Bergamo, Brescia, Casale Monferrato, Guastalla, Padua, Reggio Emilia, Rovigo, Udine, Verdara, and Verona.  At the same time he received numerous commissions from Italian patrons as diverse as Cardinal Silvio Valenti Gonzaga, the Palatine elector Karl Theodor, and Queen Louise Ulrike of Sweden.  On February 7, 1749, Rotari, in recognition of his merit as a painter, was invested with the title of \"Conte dal Senato Veneto\" by the Venetian Republic.In 1750 Rotari moved to Vienna to work for Empress Maria Theresa, producing mythological and religious paintings and portraits of the nobility.  There he encountered the work of Jean-Etienne Liotard, and his own paintings began to reveal the clear, cold colors, porcelain surfaces, and smooth handling associated with the Swiss artist's oils and pastels.  Around 1752-1753 he was summoned to Dresden by King Augustus III, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, where he painted devotional works and portraits of members of the Saxon court.  He developed there the genre upon which his fame rests:  elegant and idealized bust- and half-length studies of attractive young women in ethnic or regional dress exhibiting a broad range of expressions such as melancholy, surprise, joy, and languor.In 1755 Empress Elizabeth of Russia invited Rotari to St. Petersburg and the following year appointed him court painter.  He spent the remainder of his life working in the city and its environs for the Imperial family and for the Russian aristocracy. He produced, together with assistants, hundreds of so-called character heads, bust-length images of young woman displaying superficial psychological and emotional states.  The most famous assemblage of these is the so-called Cabinet of the Muses at Peterhof, but Rotari's works also graced other Imperial residences at Oranienbaum and Gatchina, and noble houses like Arkhangelskoye, the Yusopov palace near Moscow.Rotari is historically important as one of the main representatives of a group of Italian artists who worked in Germany, Poland, and Russia, spreading a sort of international rococo style whose Italian origin is often hardly recognizable.  He instituted at St. Petersburg a private academy of painting, and his most important Russian pupils were the painters Alexei Petrovich Antropov and Feodor Stepanovich Rokotov.  Rotari died at the Imperial court at St. Petersburg on August 31, 1762. [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "Born in 1716 in Chur, Switzerland, Jeremiah Theus emigrated to South Carolina in 1735 with other Swiss Protestants, attracted by vivid descriptions of the colony as a land of opportunity.  His training as a painter is unknown.  He settled in Charleston by 1740, the date of his first newspaper advertisement.  Like other American colonial painters, he was willing to undertake a variety of commissions, such as portraits, landscapes, and crests and coats of arms for coaches or chaises, and in 1744 he advertised the opening of an evening drawing school for \"young Gentlemen and Ladies.\"Theus was South Carolina's resident portrait painter for over three decades.  His earliest works were small.  Among his first patrons was plantation owner Barnard Elliott, for whom he painted a series of family portraits, each measuring about 20 by 16 inches.  By the mid-1750s he began to use a larger 30 by 25 inch format, the size of most of his work.  His 50 by 40 inch portrait of Mrs. Peter Manigault (The Charleston Museum) is unusually large, the pendant to the portrait of her husband by English artist Allan Ramsay.  For some portraits, especially those of women, he imitated the clothing and poses seen in imported English mezzotint engravings.  This use of prints is particularly characteristic of the period when he was making the transition to larger compositions (Severens 1985, 57).Technical examinations of the National Gallery's three portraits show that these colors were enhanced by the use of an imprimatura layer, a feature of his work that has not been previously recognized.Theus painted more than 150 portraits.  His only competition came from English painter John Wollaston, who worked in Charleston in 1765-67.  Theus died in Charleston in 1774, and his estate, including \"pictures, prints, paints, books, and personal belongings,\" was sold to produce cash legacies for his family.  Among the items were \"a great many PORTRAITS of Men, Women, and Children,\" soon advertised for sale by Edward Oats (South Carolina and American General Gazette, September 9, 1774; Archives, Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts, Winston-Salem, N.C.).

    "biography": "Joseph Wright was born in Derby on 3 September 1734, the third son of John Wright and Hannah Brookes.  He trained with Thomas Hudson from 1751 to 1753, returned to Derby as a portraitist, but, \"not being satisfied with himself,\" again studied under Hudson between 1756 and 1757, forming a lasting friendship with his fellow pupil John Hamilton Mortimer.  He toured the East Midlands as a portrait painter in 1769 and worked in Liverpool from 1768 to 1771; otherwise he practiced in Derby, and the bulk of his output was portraiture.  In the mid-1760s he began painting \"Candlelight\" pictures, his own phrase, chiefly of scientific subjects.  He quickly achieved a high reputation in this field, in which he was an innovator.  He first exhibited at the Incorporated Society of Artists in 1765, showing there regularly until 1776, when he transferred to the Royal Academy.  In 1773 he married Anne Swift, \"a person in an inferior station of life;\" the couple had six children.Wright spent nearly two years in Rome, from 1773 to 1775, where he was overwhelmed by the remains of classical antiquity and drew assiduously; on his way home he stopped briefly in Florence, Bologna, Venice, and other centers.  When he returned, Wright abandoned his scientific and industrial scenes in favor of landscapes and literary subjects.  After a disastrous two years in Bath, where he had hoped to take the place of Gainsborough, who had left for London in 1774, Wright settled in his native Derby.  He was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1781 but, after being defeated by Edmund Garvey for full Academicianship in 1783 and feeling constantly dissatisfied with the way his pictures were hung, he declined election the following year and resigned as an Associate.  In 1785 he followed Gainsborough's example and held his own exhibition of his works (at Robin's auction rooms in London).Wright was most at ease in provincial middle-class society, who were his clients, and was in close contact with the Lunar Society (a group interested in experimental science) and with leaders of the Industrial Revolution in the Midlands.  From early middle age he suffered from chronic ill health, which frequently incapacitated him for months.  His last years were marred by a plethora of complaints, and he died in Derby on 29 August 1797.

    "biography": "Little is known about Charles Amédée Philippe Van Loo (also known as Amédée Van Loo), one of a family of Flemish artists settled in France. He was born in Rivoli, near Turin, in 1719, and began his artistic instruction at an early age under his father, Jean Baptiste Van Loo (1684-1745). The young student's training adhered to traditional workshop practice with its emphasis on the copying of old masters. From this initial period of study, Amédée quickly moved to the French Academy. In 1738, he won the Prix de Rome, which took him to Italy for three years, during which time he also visited Naples and Florence. On his return to France, Amédée settled with his father in Aix-en-Provence for a period of two years.      The next significant date in Amédée's career is 1748, the year that his uncle, Carle (1705-1765), was invited to the Prussian court of Friedrich II (Frederick the Great). The obligations of the older Van Loo, who had just become the director of the École royale des élèves protégés, opened the way for his young nephew to go in his stead. During the first and longer of his two extended stays in Berlin, Amédée produced portraits of Friedrich (r. 1740-1786) and members of his court, as well as paintings of a variety of subjects and genres. Among the most important of his commissions were mythological ceiling paintings in several of the palace buildings at Potsdam. Not surprisingly, Amédée's style was influenced by Friedrich's predilection for painters of the fête galante, such as Nicolas Lancret (1690-1743) and Jean Antoine Watteau (1684-1741), whose Pilgrimage to Cythera the younger artist copied during the early years of his residence in Prussia.      In 1759, Amédée returned to Paris, where he was given a teaching post at the École des beaux-arts and a studio at the Louvre. Until 1763, when he again left France for Berlin, the painter regularly exhibited an eclectic body of works at the Salons. Responses to his works varied. Although Diderot judged Amédée to be the weakest painter in the family, he and other salon critics sometimes found the character of his figures and his palette worthy of praise. One of the artist's most inventive and consequently celebrated compositions (now lost), exhibited just prior to his second departure for Berlin, represented the virtues of Louis XV. This picture is an early example of the painter's fascination with optical themes. When looked at through a faceted lens, a portrait of the king became visible. This interest is evident in other paintings dating to Amédée's second period in Berlin (lasting until 1769), such as The Camera Obscura (1945.10.1) in the National Gallery of Art's collection.      During Amédée's final period of activity, once again as professor at the École des beaux-arts in Paris, he exhibited some of his most interesting surviving works. The Pneumatic Machine (Archangelskoie, Youssoupoff Collection), for which he posed his own family, was inspired by a picture of the same subject painted by Joseph Wright of Derby in 1767-1768. Amédée's interest in contemporary scientific culture is similarly demonstrated in his L'Electricité (Archangelskoie, Youssoupoff Collection) of 1777. He died in Paris on November 15, 1795.[Frances Gage, in French Paintings of the Fifteenth through the Eighteenth Century, The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue, Washington, D.C., 2009: 419-420.]",

    "biography": "Matthew Pratt was born in Philadelphia in 1734.  He served an apprenticeship with his uncle James Claypoole, a limner and painter, from 1749 to 1755.  Pratt opened a similar business which he interrupted with a brief speculative trading voyage to Jamaica.  When he returned to Philadelphia he began to paint portraits, at which he proved very successful.  He married Elizabeth Moore in 1760, and had two sons.  His earliest known work is a portrait of his wife (c. 1760; Private Collection).In June 1764 Pratt escorted his cousin, Betsy Shewell, to London for her marriage to Benjamin West.  Pratt remained in London as West's pupil and colleague, the first of West's many American students.  During his two and a half years with West, he painted his best-known work, The American School (1765; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), a depiction of West giving instruction to pupils in his London studio.  He also made portraits of West and his wife (Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia) as well as copies of other paintings.  He then went to Bristol, England, where for a year and a half he \"practiced to much advantage in my professional line\".  He returned to Philadelphia in March 1768 to work full-time as a portrait painter for two years.  He made a brief trip to Carlingford, Ireland, in March 1770 to claim an inheritance for his wife, and he painted a small number of portraits in Dublin and in Liverpool.Pratt was successful in the years immediately before the American Revolution.  Charles Willson Peale remembered later that Pratt at this time painted a full-length of John Dickinson and had \"a considerable number of portraits on hand.\"  He worked in New York City in 1771-72, where his commissions included a full-length portrait of Governor Cadwalader Colden (New York Chamber of Commerce), and he met John Singleton Copley.  Pratt next worked in Williamsburg, Virginia, where he advertised in The Virginia Gazette (March 4, 1773) that he was \"Lately from England and Ireland But last from New York\".Pratt's career was less successful after the Revolution.  As a partner in the firm of Pratt, Rutter & Co., which offered \"Portrait and ornamental painting\", he returned to the functional brand of painting for which Claypoole had in part trained him, and was remembered by the next generation for his unusual signs.  His work is difficult to characterize; few paintings are documented or firmly attributed.   The American School is his only signed and dated work.  This and other works from his London years show West's influence in their composition, coloring and technique.  Later portraits suggest that this style changed under the influence of other English and American painters.  Pratt died in Philadelphia in 1805.

Cotes' reputation was assured by the pastels he did in 1751 of the beautiful Gunning sisters, then idolized by society and the populace.  His practice in oils dates from the late 1750s.In 1763 Cotes bought the large and elegant house on fashionable Cavendish Square later occupied by George Romney, took in pupils, of whom Russell was the principal, and employed Peter Toms as his drapery painter.  He exhibited each year at the Society of Artists, becoming a director in 1765, the year he married Sarah (whose parentage is unknown).

    "biography": "Stubbs was born in Liverpool in 1724, the son of John Stubbs and his wife, Mary.  At the age of fifteen he was apprenticed to Hamlet Winstanley, a former friend of Arthur Devis, but left him after only a few weeks.  Apparently self-taught, he practiced as a portrait painter in various northern centers, settling in York about 1745.  Obsessed with anatomy, which he studied at York Hospital and taught privately to medical students, he was commissioned to illustrate John Burton's Essay Towards a Complete New System of Midwifery, 1751, which necessitated his learning to etch.  In 1754 he traveled to Rome, where Richard Wilson was then working, allegedly \"to convince himself that Nature is superior to all art,\" but nothing is known about his studies there.After returning to Liverpool in about 1756, Stubbs began the studies that were to result in The Anatomy of the Horse, 1766.  By then he was living with Mary Spencer, with whom he had a son; Mary was his companion until his death, but they were apparently   never married.  After completing his dissections and drawings, Stubbs came to London about 1758 to find a reproductive engraver; failing in his purpose, he eventually made the plates himself.  He had settled on Somerset Street by 1764.During the 1760s Stubbs acquired an immense reputation as a painter.  He worked on all scales, occasionally producing huge works, and he painted in this decade racing, hunting, and shooting scenes, portraits of horses and wild animals, his first dramatic subjects on the theme of a horse attacked by a lion, and conversation pieces mostly including horses.  His patrons were distinguished, and he exhibited from 1762 at the Society of Artists, of which he became president in 1772, but as an animal painter he was not made a founding member of the Royal Academy of Arts and did not switch to the exhibitions there until 1775.  He was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1780, but, though he was voted a full Academician in 1781, his election was not ratified since he never supplied a diploma picture.  This was probably the result of his displeasure at the unfavorable hanging in 1781 of his enamel paintings.  In the 1770s Stubbs' reputation suffered.  This was partly because of his categorization as a mere animal painter, and partly because of his absorption in experiments with enamel colors, a process that led to a fruitful association with Josiah Wedgwood, whose ceramic tablets he found the best support for larger paintings.In the 1780s Stubbs turned to the fashionable genre of rural scenes and to a new technique based on mezzotint, but his products were too refined to be popular.  In 1790 the Turf Review commmissioned a series of portraits of famous racehorses, to be engraved by his son; sixteen were exhibited in 1794, but none was sold and the enterprise lapsed.  In the early 1790s Stubbs also executed commissions for the Prince of Wales, but the ensuing last decade of his life seems to have been a period of financial difficulty.  During this time he devoted himself to his most ambitious project, a study of the comparative anatomy of a man, a tiger, and a chicken.  He died in London almost unnoticed on 10 July 1806.

    "biography": "Of the three most talented painters born in the British colonies of North America, Charles Willson Peale, Benjamin West and John Singleton Copley, only Peale remained in America after the Revolution.  Born in 1741 in Queen Anne's County, Maryland, and trained as a saddler, he became a painter in the 1760's by studying the work of other artists, including John Hesselius and Copley, whom he met in Boston in 1765.  Several merchants and lawyers, including John Beale Bordley, financed a two year trip in 1767-1769 to London, where Peale studied with West.  He steeped himself in English painting theory when he was in London, and corresponded with West for many years after his return to America.Peale became a portrait painter in Maryland, Virginia and in Philadelphia, where he moved with his family in 1776.  During and after the Revolution Peale combined his artistic career with Whig politics.  He served with the Pennsylvania militia in battles against the British, carrying his miniature case to paint portraits of fellow officers.  In 1779 the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania commissioned him to paint the full-length of George Washington that commemorated the victories at Princeton and Trenton, the first official portrait of Washington (Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts).  Peale's idea of a Gallery of Great Men led him to paint head and shoulder \"museum\" portraits; the first were completed by 1782.  Peale was a friend of many intellectual and political leaders and eventually painted images of many of the heroes of the war and the new republic, including Washington, Thomas Jefferson, David Rittenhouse, the Marquis de Lafayette, and Benjamin Franklin (Independence National Historical Park, Philadelphia).  He trained his brother James, his nephew Charles Peale Polk, and his sons Raphaelle, Rembrandt and Rubens Peale as painters, and was a founder of the Columbianum, the first American artists' society, which held its only public exhibition in Philadelphia in 1795.By that time Peale had established a museum of natural history in Philadelphia.  He continued to paint portraits, although he turned the business of miniature painting over to James Peale and increasingly concentrated on natural history and the museum.  Its collections, which he moved to Independence Hall in 1802, were primarily scientific and included the mastodon bones that he recovered from their New York burial place in 1801.  Although he was a founder of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1805, he painted fewer and fewer portraits, primarily of close friends and family.  One of his last works was his full-length self-portrait, The Artist in his Museum (1822; The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts).Peale's diaries and letters reveal his lifelong energy and curiosity.  His painting style was a combination of close observation, invention, and a personal interest in his sitters' lives.  His role as a painter and teacher was equal to his interests in natural science and invention.  His Whig political views placed him at the center of the formation of the new American republic, a role unlike that of his contemporaries Benjamin West and John Singleton Copley.  Peale died in Philadelphia in 1827. [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "John Durand's birth and death dates are unknown, and only a few of his portraits are signed and dated.  The sketchy chronology of his life is based on these few signed works, as well as on account book entries and information about his sitters.  Scholars place his first activity in Virginia in 1765, but by 1766 Durand was in New York City.  In that year his name appears in the account book of James Beekman of New York in an entry that records payment to \"Monsieur Duran\" for the portraits of Beekman's six children.  Nothing is known of Durand's background or artistic training, but this reference to his name in French, the rococo colors in his portraits, and his ambition to make history paintings have led some scholars to believe he was born or trained in France.  Nonetheless, his two-dimensional, linear technique, use of bright colors, and attention to detail are clearly part of the American tradition.  At about the same time that he painted the Beekmans, the artist also received portrait commissions from the prominent Ray family of New York, and, in 1768, from Garret Rapalje, a wealthy New York merchant; Durand's portrait The Rapalje Children is certainly his most ambitious work.Also about 1768, Durand traveled to New Haven, where he painted Sarah Whitehead Hubbard.  It is difficult to establish Durand's movements after this time, when he departed from New York as one of the city's most successful painters.  A signed and dated Virginia portrait indicates his return to that state in 1769.  Of Durand's work in Virginia the artist's nephew Robert Sully recalled, \"He painted an immense number of portraits in Virginia; his works are hard and dry, but appear to have been strong likenesses, with less vulgarity of style than artists of his calibre generally possess.\"  Durand returned to a \"hard and dry\" style in his later years.  Like most painters of his time, he was willing to \"paint, gild, and varnish wheel carriages; and put coats of arms, or ciphers upon them,\" as he advertised in The Virginia Gazette of 21 June 1770.  Durand also aspired to be a history painter, but as no known paintings of this genre exist by his hand, perhaps, like other artists of the time, he was disappointed by a lack of American patronage for this type of painting.Durand's return to Connecticut is confirmed by a portrait of Benjamin Douglas, signed and dated 1772.  By 1775, however, he was again seeking commissions in Virginia, evidenced by his signed and dated portraits of Mr. and Mrs.  Gray Briggs of Dinwiddie County, Virginia.  The artist may have remained there, as the only further record of his name in any state appears on a 1782 tax list for Dinwiddie County, Virginia.

    "biography": "Zoffany was born Johannes Zauffaly in Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany, on 13 March 1733, the son of Anton Franz Zauffaly.  Showing an early talent for drawing, he was apprenticed to a Regensburg painter, Martin Speer, who had been a pupil of Francesco Solimena.  After only three years of his apprenticeship had elapsed, he traveled in 1750 to Rome, where he studied under Agostino Masucci and was influenced by Mengs.  His earliest dated work is an altarpiece at Regensburg of 1753; his decorative work for the palaces of Trier and Ehrenbreitstein, done between 1757 and 1760, does not survive.In the late 1750s Zoffany married Antonie Eiselein, daughter of a court councillor at Würzburg, who became homesick and left him sometime after 1760, when he moved from Trier to London in search of fame and fortune.  After a short period of painting clock faces for Stephen Rimbault and draperies for Benjamin Wilson, he was patronized by David Garrick, for whom he did his first conversation pieces and scenes from theatrical performances.  The latter were exhibited at the Society of Artists from 1762 on and were much acclaimed.  Garrick effectively made Zoffany's reputation.  Within a year or two the artist was working for Lord Bute, who was probably responsible for his introduction to George III and Queen Charlotte, of whom he became a favorite.  In 1769 he resigned as a director of the Incorporated Society of Artists and was nominated a member of the Royal Academy.  He was naturalized in 1772.In 1771 Zoffany joined Joseph Banks' team of artists to accompany Captain Cook on his second expedition to the South Seas, but the scheme fell through. Instead in 1772 he decided to return to Italy and was commissioned by Queen Charlotte to paint the Tribuna of the Uffizi; he took with him Mary Thomas, a beautiful girl of humble origin who became the second Mrs. Zoffany and with whom he had five children.  He did not leave Florence, where he found favor with the grand duke, son of the Empress Maria Theresa, until 1778.  He then spent a year in Parma and returned to England, honored as a Baron of the Holy Roman Empire and member of the academies of Florence, Bologna, Cortona, and Parma, late in 1779.  However, Zoffany found it difficult to regain his London practice; in 1783 he sailed for India and made his fortune in Calcutta, returning to England in 1789.  He seems to have given up painting after about 1800, and died at his riverside home near Kew, at Strand-on-the-Green, Chiswick, on 11 November 1810.

    "biography": "George Romney was born in Dalton-on-Furness, Lancashire, on 15 December 1734, the third of the eleven children of John Romney and Anne Simpson.  Leaving school at the age of eleven, he worked for eight years in his father's cabinetmaking workshop before being apprenticed to a local painter, Christopher Steele, with whom he served for two years, from 1755 to 1757, in Kendal, York, and Lancaster.  He married a Kendal girl, Mary Abbot, on 14 October 1756, and painted at Kendal from 1756 to 1762, principally small full-length portraits.In 1762 Romney settled in London, leaving his wife and son behind, and henceforward saw them only on his few visits to the north.  He won premiums for his historical paintings from the Society of Arts in 1763 and 1765, and exhibited at the Free Society between 1763 and 1769, and with the Society of Artists from 1770 to 1772.  During a visit to Paris in the autumn of 1764 he was deeply impressed by the classicism of Eustache Le Sueur.  His portraits were chiefly influenced by Ramsay.  In 1773 he traveled to Italy with the miniaturist Ozias Humphry, remaining there until 1775, chiefly in Rome.On his return to London Romney was patronized by the Duke of Richmond, in whose celebrated gallery of casts he had formerly studied, and took the grand house in Cavendish Square, with its large painting room, previously occupied by Francis Cotes.  He achieved an instant success, and his unremitting application as a society portraitist is amply documented by his sitter books, which survive for the years 1776 to 1795.  He never bothered to exhibit at the Royal Academy of Arts, though this was partly due to an antagonism with Reynolds.  His health affected by overapplication, he gave up portrait painting at the end of 1795 and retired to Hampstead.  In 1798 he sold the lease of his London house and returned to Kendal, where he died insane on 15 November 1802.

    "biography": "Thomas Gainsborough was born in Sudbury, Suffolk, the youngest of the nine children of John Gainsborough and the sister of the Reverend Humphry Burroughs; he was baptized in Sudbury on 14 May 1727.  He attended Sudbury Grammar School, of which his maternal uncle was the master.  He took to sketching at an early age, and when he was thirteen prevailed upon his father to send him up to London to become an artist.  A pupil of the French illustrator and draftsman Hubert Gravelot, Gainsborough was intimately involved with avant-garde rococo art and design, and seems to have assisted Francis Hayman on his genre paintings for the decoration of Vauxhall Gardens.After a short period on his own in London between about 1744 and 1748, during which he painted small-scale portraits and landscapes in the manner of Jan Wijnants and Jacob van Ruisdael, and married Margaret Burr, Gainsborough returned to his native Suffolk.  After a few years in Sudbury he moved, in 1752, to the larger seaport town of Ipswich.  There is only one, uncorroborated, reference (to a visit to Flanders in later life) to suggest that he ever traveled abroad, as was customary among his fellow artists.  By 1759, still finding it difficult to make ends meet and now with two daughters to support, he realized he had exhausted the possibilities of local patronage and moved to the fashionable spa town of Bath, where he achieved instantaneous success.Set back by a nervous illness in 1763, he later became a founding member of the Royal Academy of Arts, contributing to its first exhibition a scintillating female full-length portrait in the manner of Van Dyck.  Unlike many of his contemporaries, Gainsborough customarily painted his portraits entirely with his own hand; his only known assistant was his nephew Gainsborough Dupont, who was apprenticed to him in 1772.In 1774 Gainsborough moved to London, where he settled in a wing of Schomberg House, Pall Mall.  In 1777 he received the first of many commissions from the royal family.  In 1780 he exhibited a wide range of landscape compositions, and in 1783 made a tour of the Lake District in search of picturesque scenery.  An original printmaker, he experimented in these years with soft-ground etching and aquatint; influenced by Philippe-Jacques de Loutherbourg's popular entertainment, the Eidophusikon, he also constructed a peep-show box in which transparencies were seen magnified and lit by candles from behind, producing a dramatic and colorful effect.  After quarreling with the Royal Academy about the hanging of his pictures (he rarely participated in Academy affairs), from 1784 onward Gainsborough arranged annual exhibitions in his studio.  He was by then comparatively well off.  He died of cancer in London on 2 August 1788.

    "biography": "Claude-Joseph Vernet was born in Avignon in 1714, the son of Antoine Vernet (1689-1753), an artisan painter of architectural decorations, coach panels, and the like. He moved to the studio of Philippe Sauvan (1697-1792), a leading history painter in Avignon, and then worked with Jacques Viali (active 1681-1745), a decorative, landscape, and marine painter in Aix-en-Provence. Vernet's first recorded paintings were decorative overdoors executed in 1731 in the Aix townhouse of the marquise de Simiane. In 1734, Joseph de Seytres, marquis de Caumont, a leading amateur in Avignon, sponsored Vernet to make a study trip to Italy to complete his artistic education and to draw antiquities for his patron.      As Avignon was a papal territory in Vernet's day, he also had a number of useful introductions among influential churchmen when he arrived in Rome. Vernet was soon at home in the French community there, and he was encouraged by Nicolas Vleughels (1668-1737), director of the Académie de France in Rome, even though the young painter had no official affiliation with the royal institution. He likely entered the studio of the French marine painter Adrien Manglard (1695-1760). By 1740 Vernet was developing an independent reputation as a painter of topographical landscape in and around Rome and Naples, as well as of imaginary Italianate landscapes and marines, demonstrated by the increasing number of entries in his surviving account books from the mid-1730s onward. His first important patron in Rome was the French ambassador Paul Hippolyte de Beauvillier, duc de Saint-Aignan (1684-1776). This relationship set a pattern, and members of the French diplomatic corps and visiting French prelates remained important patrons during Vernet's long Roman sojourn, which lasted almost twenty years (he returned definitively to France in 1753). He also worked for the Roman nobility--for example, painting a series of major marines for Don Giacomo Borghese (Rome, Palazzo Borghese). But it was the British--the wealthiest travelers in Europe--who became Vernet's main patrons during their Grand Tours, purchasing Italianate landscapes and marines as souvenirs of their visits to Italy. The British remained enthusiastic patrons of Vernet, even long after his return to France.      The appeal of Vernet's art was twofold. On the one hand, he drew on the tradition of ideal landscape painting codified by Claude Lorrain (1604/1605-1682), Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665), Gaspard Dughet (1615-1675), and Salvator Rosa (1615-1673) in seventeenth-century Italy. Inspired by the landscape of the Roman Campagna and its surrounding hills, and by the coastline south to Naples, these artists had created appropriate landscape settings for narratives from ancient history or mythology, or in which the classically educated viewer could wander in his imagination. Vernet, on the other hand, brought to the study of nature a more empirical and closely observed approach, consistent with his times, creating what seemed to his contemporaries a more vivid and convincing impression of nature. This effect was enhanced by the fact that he usually conceived his pictures in pairs, or even sets of four, which showed dramatically contrasting aspects of nature. Having established these kinds of paintings as successful formulas by the mid-1740s, Vernet continued to supply a European demand for them for the rest of his career. Vernet first exhibited typical landscapes and marines at the Paris Salon of 1746, the year his membership in the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture was approved. He became a full member in 1753 and exhibited successfully at the Salon for the rest of his life. He had come to the attention of Louis XV's administration in 1746, and in 1753 he was finally called back to France to begin an official commission to paint large topographical views of the principal commercial and military seaports of the realm. This commission took him on an arduous itinerary, from Antibes in the south to Dieppe in the north, from 1753 until 1765, during which time he completed fifteen large paintings. Vernet's \"Ports of France\" (Paris, Musée du Louvre) are among the greatest French paintings of the mid-eighteenth century, for they are both remarkable social and historical documents of contemporary port life, full of fascinating observation, and at the same time beautifully composed and rendered works of art.      Vernet continued a large production of imaginary landscape and marine paintings until his death on the eve of the French Revolution in 1789. He was one of the most acclaimed and successful artists in France, and he received commissions from every corner of Europe. The public and critics alike admired his art, and the great writer and critic Denis Diderot (1713-1784) eulogized him. Diderot especially admired Vernet's dramatic scenes of shipwrecks, which perfectly illustrate the contemporary concept of the Sublime, expressing with horror the ephemeral quality of human endeavor before the immutable power of nature.[Philip Conisbee, in French Paintings of the Fifteenth through the Eighteenth Century, The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue, Washington, D.C., 2009: 431.]",

    "biography": "Wheatley was born in London in 1747, the son of a master tailor in Covent Garden.  First placed under Daniel Fournier, a neighbor who was a drawing master, he was subsequently trained at the drawing school run by William Shipley, the founder of the (Royal) Society of Arts.  He was a pupil of an unidentified Mr. Wilson, perhaps Benjamin Wilson, when, in 1762, he won the Society's premium for a drawing of the human figure.  In 1763 he won a similar prize and is recorded as traveling abroad, perhaps in France and the Low Countries.  In 1766 he won the Society's second prize for a landscape drawn from nature.  In 1769 he entered the Royal Academy Schools as one of its first students.  In 1770 he was elected a member of the Society of Artists, where he had first exhibited in 1765, becoming a director in 1774.  He assisted John Hamilton Mortimer on the decoration of the ceiling of the saloon at Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire, between 1771 and 1773, and later in the decade went on sketching tours, for example to Devonshire in 1778.Wheatley lived extravagantly and ran into debt; in 1779, with the aid of a loan from Benjamin West which he never repaid, he went to Dublin with the wife of a fellow artist, J. A. Gresse, whom he passed off as his own.  In 1783 he returned to England.  Finding it difficult to reestablish himself, he applied the following year to the East India Company to practice as a portrait painter in India, but he did not go.  He worked more and more for the print sellers, beginning his long association with John Boydell, for whose Shakespeare Gallery he later painted thirteen canvases.  Sometime before 1788 he married Clara Maria Leigh, daughter of a proctor in Doctors' Commons, St. Paul's Churchyard, with whom he had four children.During the first half of his career Wheatley painted small-scale portraits in which figures--the ladies with gaily colored apparel--were informally posed and silhouetted against darker landscape backgrounds.  He also produced conversation pieces and landscapes, both in oil and watercolor, in which everyday rustic incidents were featured.  After his return to London in 1783, Wheatley concentrated on his work for which he is best known, sentimental scenes inspired by Greuze and the cult of sensibilité, mostly intended for engraving and for distribution on the French as well as the English market.  He painted the celebrated canvas of John Howard visiting and relieving the miseries of a prison, bourgeois moralities, scenes from modern literature, and fancy pictures--genre pictures in which sentiment was combined with domestic or rustic realism.Wheatley was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1790 and became a full Academician in 1791.  Though he was popular and hard working, what little is known of Wheatley's prices does not suggest that he was normally well paid, and by 1793 he was again seriously in debt.  For the last seven years of his life he was not only in constant financial difficulties but severely crippled by gout, the result of youthful dissipation.  He died in London on 28 June 1801.

    "biography": "Born in Paris in 1733, Hubert Robert was a landscape draftsman and painter whose early training was sponsored by members of the Choiseul family, the employers of his parents who were retainers in their household. In 1754 he traveled to Rome in the entourage of France's new ambassador to the papal court, Étienne François, comte de Stainville, the future duc de Choiseul (1719-1785), a political ally of the marquise de Pompadour (1721-1764). As a special favor, he resided at the Académie de France, where he studied with the school's master of perspective, the vedutista Giovanni Paolo Panini (c. 1692-1765) and sought the advice of the printmaker and draftsman Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-1778). From them he learned to experiment with the complexities of ancient Roman and modern Italian architecture, and in response to their work he learned to arbitrarily combine and contextualize ruins, transposing them into compositions that he filled with erudite references to the distant past and animated with picturesque staffage. He was befriended by his compatriot Jean Honoré Fragonard (1732-1806), with whom he drew and painted landscapes in and around Rome. Robert remained in Italy for a decade, returning to Paris in 1765. He would ultimately draw much of his imagery from the studies he made during his Italian sojourn. He was almost immediately admitted to full membership in the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture.      Topography per se and the direct observation of nature held little interest for Robert; he specialized in capricci, idealized landscape and architectural fantasies. An artist of amazing versatility and technical virtuosity, he painted subject matter ranging from the frivolous to the sublime. He could paint on virtually any scale, from colossal decorations to pictures the size of large miniatures. He developed a rapid alla prima technique in which detail was sacrificed for an overall effect. During the final decades of the ancien régime, the indefatigable Robert was widely recognized not only as one of France's preeminent landscape and view painters but also as an accomplished and highly resourceful garden designer. His clientele included royalty, the aristocracy, and the wealthiest segments of the middle class, as well as foreign dignitaries. Imprisoned during the French Revolution, he survived the Reign of Terror.      Under the Directoire, Hubert Robert was reinstated in his official position as a curator of the Louvre, serving first as a member of the Conservatoire and, until late 1802, as part of the governing council of the Musée Central des Arts. He helped organize temporary exhibitions in the museum before its official opening in 1801. The artist's energy never lagged. He exhibited regularly at the Salon until 1798. Hubert Robert died in his studio at Auteuil of an attack of apoplexy on April 15, 1808, at the age of seventy-five. An exhaustive catalogue of his paintings, drawings, and prints would have to account for several thousand works.[Joseph Baillio, in French Paintings of the Fifteenth through the Eighteenth Century, The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue, Washington, D.C., 2009: 403.]",

    "biography": "Winthrop Chandler was born on 6 April 1747 at Chandler Hill, the family farm located on the town line of Woodstock and Thompson, Connecticut.  One source states that the artist \"studied the art of portrait painting in Boston.\"  Although there is no other documentary evidence of this artistic training, an eight-year absence from the Woodstock area (1762-1770) corresponds to the usual term for apprenticeships.  His receipt of an important commission soon after his return also seems to support this claim.Chandler married Mary Gleason in 1772, and the couple had five sons and two daughters.  Despite a modest family inheritance, Chandler soon began to experience financial difficulties that would continue throughout his life.  In contrast to the many itinerant artists of the time, Chandler did not travel in search of commissions, and most of his sitters were family members or neighbors.  In addition to portraits, some landscapes have been attributed to him.In 1785 Chandler moved to Worcester, Massachusetts, where he remained for five years.  During this period his son Charles as well as his wife died, and his remaining children were sent to live with relatives.  Although he painted houses to supplement his income, Chandler was unable to support himself.  He returned to Chandler Hill where he died on 29 July 1790.  Chandler was so destitute that he left his remaining property to the selectmen of Thompson to pay his medical and funeral expenses.

Dupont was much employed by George III, who admired his work, and to William Pitt he owed his principal commission, a large group portrait.  Thomas Harris, the proprietor of Covent Garden Theatre, engaged him to paint a series of portraits of actors.  He also painted landscapes.  On three occasions he tried, unsuccessfully, to secure election as an Associate of the Royal Academy.  He died in London on 20 January 1797.

Hoppner encouraged the belief--rife in his lifetime--that he was a natural son of George II's grandson, the future George III.  Certainly Hoppner was brought up at court, and it was George III who asked John Chamberlaine, later keeper of the royal drawings, to supervise his education.  He entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1775, and received medals in 1778 and 1782.In 1781 Hoppner married Phoebe, the youngest daughter of a Mr. Wright, an American, whose wife had emigrated to England after his death.  There were five children.  In 1784 he settled in Charles Street, between the Haymarket and St.  James's Square, where he fitted up a handsome studio and gallery; he remained there, practicing as a portrait painter, for the rest of his life.  By 1784 he was working for Queen Charlotte; he was successively Portrait Painter (1789) and Principal Painter (1793) to the Prince of Wales, and was patronized by the Carlton House set.Hoppner became an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1793, and a full Academician in 1795.  He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1780 until 1809, and from the early 1790s he, Beechey, and Lawrence were rivals in portraiture, competing at the annual academy exhibition and dividing the favors of society among them.Plagued with prolonged ill health, Hoppner seems to have been of an irritable and spiteful disposition.  He wrote art criticism for the Morning Post, which was often vitrolic, and, one of the best-informed painters of his time, became a contributor to the new Quarterly Review in 1809.  He died in London on 23 January 1810, his death hardly noticed.  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "Gilbert Stuart was the preeminent portraitist in Federal America.  He combined a talent for recording likeness with an ability to interpret a sitter's personality or character in the choice of pose, color and style of clothing, and setting.  He introduced to America the loose, brushy style used by many of the leading artists of late eighteenth century London.  He recorded likenesses of lawyers, politicians, diplomats, native Americans, their wives and children.  His sitters included many prominent Americans, among them the first five presidents, their advisors, families, and admirers.  He is known especially for his numerous portraits of George Washington.Born in 1755 in North Kingston, Rhode Island, Stuart was baptized with his name spelled \"Stewart\".  His father, an immigrant Scot, built and operated a snuff mill that may have led to the artist's addiction to snuff.  He grew up in the trading city of Newport, where itinerant Scottish portraitist Cosmo Alexander (1724-1772) gave him his earliest training in painting.  He accompanied Alexander to Scotland in 1771, returning home at the older artist's death.  Three years later in 1775, on the eve of the American Revolution, he went to London, where he worked for five years (1777-1782) as assistant to the Anglo-American painter Benjamin West.  He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1777 to 1785, using the name Gilbert Charles Stuart the first year.  The success of The Skater (NGA 1950.18.1), painted in 1782, enabled him to establish his own business as a portrait painter.  In 1786 Stuart married Charlotte Coates, and the following year they went to Dublin, where Stuart painted portraits of the Protestant ruling minority for over five years.Stuart returned to the United States in 1793, planning to paint a portrait of George Washington that would establish his reputation in America.  After about a year in New York City, he went to Philadelphia, the capital of the United States, with a letter of introduction to Washington from John Jay.  He painted the president in the winter or early spring of 1795.  He was not satisfied with his first life portrait of Washington, but others were.  Martha Washington commissioned a second and Mrs. William Bingham commissioned two full-lengths.  His success led immediately to many other commissions.  His sitters were politically prominent and wealthy, from the merchant and landed classes.  After Washington, D.C. became the new national capital, Stuart moved there in December of 1803, and this group continued as his patrons.  There he painted the Madisons, Jefferson, the Thorntons, and others from Jefferson's administration.In the summer of 1805 Stuart settled in Boston.  In his Roxbury studio he continued to paint politically and socially prominent sitters and, on request, to make replicas of his second \"Athenaeum\" portrait of George Washington.  Throughout his life younger artists, including John Trumbull, Thomas Sully, Rembrandt Peale, and John Vanderlyn, sought his advice and imitated his work.  Among his students were his children Charles Gilbert (1787-1813) and Jane (1812-1888).  One indication of Stuart's popularity is the number of portraits he painted, over a thousand during his long career, excluding copies of the portraits of Washington.  Another indication is the number of copies of his work that other artists made.  His sitters indicated their fascination for his talent and personality by recording lengthy anecdotes and descriptions of their sittings, producing an unusally rich written record about an American portraitist.  Stuart died in Boston in 1828.  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes still awaits a rigorously documented biography, especially for his early career and travels, before he settled into official artistic life in Paris in 1787. Born in Toulouse in 1750, he trained at the local art academy under the history painter Jean Baptiste Despax (1709-1773) and the miniaturist Guillaume Gabriel Bouton. According to Robert Mesuret, he was sponsored by a member of the Parlement of Toulon, Mathias du Bourg, who may have underwritten a first trip to Rome in 1769. In the early 1770s (and by 1773, on the evidence of dated drawings made in the Paris area), Valenciennes was in Paris, where he entered the studio of the history painter Gabriel François Doyen (1726-1806) in 1773. He began a four-year visit to Italy in 1777, documented by drawings made on the outward journey. While in Paris for a brief stay in 1781-1782, Valenciennes wrote that he met the landscape and marine painter Claude Joseph Vernet (1714-1789), who gave him valuable instruction in the science of perspective; however, it is perhaps more likely that such lessons would have been imparted during Valenciennes' student days in the early 1770s. The present writer and others have suggested that during the 1781-1782 encounter, Vernet introduced Valenciennes to the practice of painting landscape oil studies in the open air. Certainly, the older painter's precocious naturalism and his contemporary reputation as a plein-air painter make him an important predecessor for Valenciennes' own practice and his theories of landscape painting. It is assumed--although not proven--that Valenciennes' series of open-air landscape studies in oil, made in and around Rome, date to his return to Italy for another three or four years, from 1782 to 1785 or 1786. Most of the surviving oil studies are now in the Musée du Louvre.      Through both his artistic practice and his theoretical writing Valenciennes holds a position of considerable importance in the history of landscape painting of the late eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries. In 1800 he published the influential treatise on landscape painting, Elémens de perspective practique, à l'usage des artistes, suivis de Réflexions et conseils à un élève sur la peinture, et particulièrement sur le genre du paysage, which was still recommended by Camille Pissarro (1830-1903) in the 1880s. Much of this book is devoted to the detailed study of perspective. But Valenciennes was perhaps more influential for his advocacy of an almost systematic program of study by painting oil sketches from nature out-of-doors, which he believed was a better way for the young artist to understand nature's myriad appearances and to train the hand and eye in capturing them in paint. This theory was based on Valenciennes' own experience of painting oil studies in the open air during his last Italian sojourn between 1782 and 1785. He passed on the practice of painting open-air landscape studies in oil to his pupils, including Achille Etna Michallon (1796-1822) and Jean Joseph Xavier Bidauld (1758-1846). This working method became a cornerstone of landscape painting in the nineteenth century, from Camille Corot (1796-1875), who studied with his precocious contemporary Michallon, to Paul Cézanne (1839-1906), who was mentored in plein-air painting by Pissarro.      In 1787 Valenciennes was elected to the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture in Paris. His reception piece was Cicero Discovering the Tomb of Archimedes (Toulouse, Musée des Augustins). This painting would define the art of the historical landscape for a century, echoing the ideal landscapes of Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665) and Claude Lorrain (1604/1605-1682) and raising the academic status of landscape painting from the lowly representation of brute nature to an art form that could embody noble ideas. The subject also hints at Valenciennes' admiration for the great geometer Archimedes, whose calculations form the basis of scientific perspective. Valenciennes rapidly rose in the academic hierarchy, becoming professor of perspective at the Académie and earning official lodgings in the Louvre. From this important position he had a decisive influence on the rise and development of landscape painting in early nineteenth-century France. He lived to see the establishment in 1816 of the Rome Prize for landscape painting, which marked the complete acceptance of landscape painting into the academic system. Later generations would react against the classicizing constraints of historical landscape and follow instead Valenciennes' other practices and precepts by studying nature at first hand.[Philip Conisbee, in French Paintings of the Fifteenth through the Eighteenth Century, The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue, Washington, D.C., 2009: 409-410.]",

    "biography": "John Trumbull is known for his portraits and history paintings of the leaders and events of the American Revolution.  Born in 1756 in Lebanon, Connecticut, he graduated from Harvard College in 1773 and served with the Connecticut First Regiment in the early months of the revolution.  He began his painting career in 1777.  He went to England to study briefly with Benjamin West in 1780, returning in 1784 for a longer period.  The critical era of his life, and that of his finest work, was from 1784 to 1794.  In March 1785 he wrote to his father, Jonathan Trumbull, Sr., that \"the great object of my wishes...is to take up the History of Our Country, and paint the principal Events particularly of the late War.\" (Connecticut Historical Society, quoted in Cooper 1982, 7)  Influenced by the work of West and Copley, he completed his first history painting, The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker's Hill (Yale University Art Gallery), in March 1786.  He began the composition of The Declaration of Independence (Yale University Art Gallery) while visiting Thomas Jefferson in Paris that July.  There he also visited private paintings collections and met Jacques-Louis David and Jean-Antoine Houdon, travelling to Germany and the Low Countries before going back to London.Trumbull returned to the United States in the fall of 1789. For the next four years he travelled along the East coast, painting the portraits he needed for his history paintings.  His small oil portraits, his oil sketches for these history paintings, and his life portraits, especially the full-lengths of the 1790's, were influenced by his work with West and his knowledge of French painting.  His friendships with Jefferson, John Adams and other political leaders gave him distinct advantages.In 1794, after the death of his cousin Harriet Wadsworth (1769- 1793), whom he wished to marry, he accepted an offer from John Jay to serve as secretary with the Jay Treaty Commission in London.  He resumed his painting career in England in 1800, the year he married Sarah Hope Harvey.  He returned to the United States in 1804, planning to settle in Boston.  When he learned that Gilbert Stuart intended to move there from Washington, he went instead to New York, thinking that \"Boston...did by no means offer an adequate field of success for two rival artists\" (Autobiography, 1841, quoted in Cooper 1982, 13).  His portraits from this period were influential on the work of younger American artists.  He was elected to the board of directors of the New York Academy of the Fine Arts (later the American Academy of the Fine Arts).  However the economic consequences of the Embargo Act of 1807, restricting foreign trade, cut short his success.  He left in 1808 for Connecticut, and then for a sketching trip through New York State and eastern Canada.  He had been blinded in one eye in a childhood accident, and returned to England with is wife in 1809 for treatment of his failing eyesight.  Some observers, including contemporaries, attribute Trumbull's particular success with small-scale paintings to this lack of full eyesight.Trumbull and his wife returned to America at the end of the War of 1812. In 1817 he received a commission for four large history paintings for the rotunda of the United States Capitol in Washington.  That same year he was elected President of the American Academy of the Fine Arts, which under his strict guidance came in the 1820's to represent an older, more traditional group of artists.  He completed the Capitol pictures in 1824.  When he failed to receive further federal commissions, he turned again to portraiture.  In difficult financial straits, he offered his painting collection to Yale College in return for an annuity.  The offer was accepted in 1831 and the Trumbull Gallery opened the following year.  His autobiography, written after he retired from the presidency of the academy in 1836, recalls his long career.  He died in New York at the age of eighty-seven in 1843.

    "biography": "Robert Edge Pine was an English portraitist and history painter who spent the last four years of his life in the United States.  He was one of the first artists to paint history paintings of the events of the American Revolution.Pine was born in London, around 1730, the son of engraver John Pine.  His exact birth date has never been discovered, and nothing is known of his training.  In 1760 he won first prize from the Society for the Encouragement of the Arts for his Surrender of Calais to Richard III (unlocated).  He exhibited regularly at the Society of Artists and the Free Society of Artists from 1763 until 1772, when he moved to Bath.  Already sympathetic to the American cause, he painted an allegory in 1778 titled America (engraved, 1781; destroyed by fire, 1803), showing a suffering \"America\" visited by Liberty, Concord, Plenty and Peace.  In Bath he met George William Fairfax, close friend and neighbor of George Washington.  Another patron was Samuel Vaughan, a London merchant and friend of Benjamin Franklin, who commissioned Pine to paint portraits of his children.At the end of the American Revolution Pine decided to go to the United States and asked Samuel Vaughan's son John about \"the present state of the country, with respect to the disposition and ability of its inhabitants for giving encouragement to Painting, either at Portraits or in perpetuating to Posterity the many glorious Acts which honours the name of an American.\" (Letter of April 29, 1784, Dreer collection, Historical Society of Pennsylvania, quoted in Stewart 1979, 20).  On August 23rd Fairfax sent Washington a print of Pine's America and recommended Pine to Washington and his friends.  After his arrival in Philadelphia, Pine obtained permission to use a room in the State House (Independence Hall) as an exhibition space and painting room for his projected series of paintings of the events of the Revolution.  Despite the patronage of financier Robert Morris, only one painting from the projected series, Congress Voting Independence, was completed (destroyed 1803; copied in oil and engraved by Edward Savage).Pine's technique for completing his portraits was unusual.  \"His custom was, on small, thin pieces of canvas, to paint the heads of his sitters, making on paper pencil sketches of their figures, so that on his return home, having pasted his heads upon larger canvases, he and his two daughters could rapidly finish them.\" (Rembrandt Peale, 1865, quoted by Stewart 1979, 29).  In some cases, rather than gluing the small head to the larger canvas, he would fit it into a space in the larger fabric that was especially cut to match its dimensions. Twenty-two American portraits with this piecing technique are known.After Pine's death in Philadelphia in November 1788, the paintings in his studio were purchased by wax modeler Daniel Bowen, who exhibited them with other objects in his museum in Philadelphia, New York and Boston, beginning in 1792.  Nearly all of Pine's paintings were destroyed by fire in 1803, leaving two family groups and about forty individual portraits as examples of his American work.

    "biography": "Daniel Gardner was born in Kendal, Lancashire, in 1750.  As a boy Gardner received some instruction from Romney, went up to London in 1767 or 1768, and was entered at the Royal Academy Schools in March 1770.  In 1771 he was awarded the Academy's silver medal for a drawing of Academy Figures and exhibited there for the first and only time in his life, preferring, like Romney, to rely for patronage on his connections.After Gardner left the Royal Academy Schools Reynolds invited him into his studio, where he remained for a short time.  A hard-working artist, he started his career in London as a pastelist, painted his first oil in 1779, but worked rarely in that medium and established his reputation with his gouache portraits.  His account books have disappeared, and few of his works are datable; equally little is known about his life.  He married Ann, the sister of Francis Haward, the engraver, in 1776 or 1777, but she died a few years later in childbirth and he seems to have developed into a lonely eccentric.  One of his principal patrons was Sir William Heathcote, of whose family he painted at least twenty-five portraits.  He visited Paris in 1802 or 1803 to study the sculpture in the Louvre, and died in London on 8 July 1805.

    "biography": "The Sherman Limner, whose appellation derives from his portraits of the prominent Sherman family of New Haven, Connecticut, was active circa the late years of the eighteenth century, between 1785 and 1790.  Works by The Sherman Limner share certain characteristics which make possible the attribution of a number of paintings.  The artist's style is distinguished by tight, even brushwork, thinly applied paint, and the careful rendering of costume details.  A moderate understanding of the principles of modeling keeps the reliance upon outline to a minimum.  The props and poses of the figures in The Sherman Limner's paintings indicate that the artist had some knowledge of eighteenth-century academic portraiture.  Creating the illusion of a realistic spatial setting appears not to have interested The Sherman Limner.  Backgrounds vary from murky outdoor views, to unarticulated planes of paint, to confined interior spaces.  The embellishment of the interiors ranges from ornate to elementary.In 1957 Susan Sawitzky proposed Abraham Delanoy, Jr. (1742-1795) as the artist of The Sherman Limner portraits.  A colonial painter who studied in London with Benjamin West, Delanoy is recognized mainly for his accomplished portraits of New York City's Beekman family.  Sawitzky's argument, which has been rejected by some scholars and accepted by others, is problematic.  Two pieces of documentary evidence form the basis of her identification.  First, three advertisements in New Haven's Connecticut Journal in 1784, 1785, and 1786 establish Delanoy's presence in that city.  The component of the argument that links Delanoy to the Sherman family is less conclusive.  An inscription, now preserved only in a photograph of the back of a painting, reads, Roger Sherman Aged 14, [?] / Apr. 19 1735 / A. Delanoy Pinxit.  Sawitzky accepts only the name of the artist.  Her theory that the identity of the sitter and the date had been either altered or added to make the painting more appealing to a twentieth-century descendant/buyer sheds doubt on the integrity of the inscription.Genuine similarities, however, do exist between the accepted Delanoys and The Sherman Limner works, and there is also an irrefutable likeness between some of their paintings.  Sawitsky hypothesizes that the decline in Delanoy's social and professional standing, chronicled by William Dunlap, accounts for the change in style between the portraits of the 1760s and the Sherman and related portraits of the 1780s.  Dunlap knew Delanoy just before his move to New Haven: \"I remember Delanoy from 1780 to 1783, in the 'sear and yellow leaf' of both life and fortune.  He was consumptive, poor, and his only employment sign-painting.\"  Nonetheless, is seems unlikely that this alone could account for the major stylistic differences between the two groups of works.Two more likely possibilities for the artist of The Sherman Limner portraits suggest themselves.  Whether Delanoy took on painting students is not known, but Dunlap mentions him in this context.  The exchange between student and teacher might well account for the relationship between Delanoy's work in New York and The Sherman Limner portraits.  Delanoy also mentions a \"good and steady Workman to assist\" in his 1786 Connecticut Journal advertisement.  That the painter of the later works was either a student or an assistant would account more easily for both the similarities and the differences among the portraits than the hypothesis that they are by the same hand.

He was one of the American artists who made their way to Europe during and immediately after the American revolution, to study painting.  He went first to Paris, and arrived in London in 1781 with an introduction to Benjamin West from Benjamin Franklin.  Planning to be a miniature painter, Brown entered the school of the Royal Academy.  He worked also in West's studio, where his style was influenced by Gilbert Stuart's and where his ambitions changed to the pursuit of a career as a portrait and history painter.  Unlike most of the Americans who studied with West, Brown chose to remain in England for the rest of his life, and West's influence throughout Brown's career was very strong.The success of two religious paintings done in 1784 for St. Mary's in the Strand, London, led Brown to found a partnership with the painter Daniel Orme for the commercialization of these and other works through exhibition and the sale of engravings. Among these were large paintings of scenes from English history, as well as scenes from Shakespeare's plays.  In 1784-1785 Brown painted portraits of John Adams, his wife and daughter, and in 1786 he painted Thomas Jefferson.  His full-length portraits of the Duke of York and the Prince of Wales, done in 1788 and 1789 respectively, led to his appointment as official portrait painter of the duke.A falling off of patronage in the mid-1790s, and failure to be elected to the Royal Academy, led Brown to leave London in 1808 for Bath, Bristol, and Liverpool.  He settled in Manchester, returning to London almost two decades later, in 1824, where, even after West's death, he continued to imitate his teacher's style of painting.

    "biography": "Ralph Earl was born in 1751 in Worcester County, Massachusetts, the son of a farmer.  He learned the trade of painting portraits by observing the work of others.  Both he and his younger brother James (1761-1796) became painters.  In 1774 he settled in New Haven, where he painted portraits for three years and married his cousin, Sarah Gates.  During these years John Singleton Copley, especially through his portraits of Adam Babcock (NGA 1978.79.1) and Mrs. Adam Babcock (NGA 1985.20.1), was an important influence.Earl was a Loyalist and fled Connecticut during the American Revolution to escape certain imprisonment as a spy.  Abandoning his family, he disguised himself as the servant of British Army captain John Money and accompanied Money to England in the spring of 1778.  He settled in Money's home town of Norwich, where he painted his first English portraits.  By 1783 he was in London, a student of Benjamin West.  Four of his portraits were exhibited at the annual exhibitions of the Royal Academy in 1783-1785, and his approximately two dozen English portraits indicate that he successfully adopted the cosmopolitan London manner.Earl returned to the United States in 1785 with an English bride, Ann Whiteside, and sent an announcement of his return to newspapers in Hartford, Connecticut and Worcester, Massachusetts.  In New York City in September 1786 he was sentenced to prison because of nonpayment of personal debts, and was supported by the Society for the Relief of Distressed Debtors while in jail.  The Society's members sent their families and friends to the artist to have their portraits painted.  Other sitters were members of the recently formed Society of the Cincinnati.Released from prison in January 1788, Earl returned to Connecticut.  His patron was Dr. Mason Fitch Cogswell, a founding member of the Society for the Relief of Distressed Debtors, who gave the artist introductions to his many friends, acquaintances and even his patients.  Earl found enthusiastic patronage for his portraits among the social leaders of western and central Connecticut.  His sitters during the next decade included the Boardmans and Taylors of New Milford, the Wolcotts of Litchfield, and the Ellsworths of Hartford.  They are often portrayed in richly detailed domestic settings or in front of landscapes of the towns they lived in.  For the next decade Earl successfully translated his English experience into a new Connecticut style, and he often painted on coarsely woven large canvases that give his work a rough finish.  He also painted on Long Island, in New York City and, toward the end of his career, in western Massachusetts and southern Vermont.  The scale of these portraits and their rich colors and detailing had an impact on local artists like Joseph Steward of Hartford, who imitated Earl's new Connecticut manner with great success.Earl was also a landscape painter.  He frequently included landscape backgrounds in his portraits and was commissioned to paint separate views of his patrons' houses.  In the late 1790's he painted a panorama of Niagara Falls (unlocated).  He died in 1801 in Bolton, Connecticut, of alcoholism, the disease that had plagued him since his confinement in the New York debtors' prison.[This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "Jean Joseph Xavier Bidauld was born in Carpentras, Provence, and in 1768 moved to Lyon, where he studied until 1774 with his brother, the landscape and still life painter Jean Pierre Xavier Bidauld (1745-1813). In the later 1770s the brothers traveled to Switzerland, where they discovered the beauty and grandeur of the Swiss landscape and were exposed to the ideas of Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778). By 1783 Bidauld was in Paris, where he met the great landscape painter Claude Joseph Vernet (1714-1789) and likely took lessons from him. A picture dealer and perfumier, M. Dulac, took Bidauld under his wing and employed him in copying and restoring works of the seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish schools.      Dulac helped finance a trip to Italy that was also underwritten by the cardinal de Bernis. Bidauld arrived in Rome in November 1785, staying there for five years. During this time Bidauld made many trips into the Roman Campagna and further afield to the hill towns of Subiaco, Narni, Civita Castellana, Isola di Sora, the mountains of the Abruzzi, and south to Naples. He liked to be absorbed into nature, favoring remote, silent places, verdant valleys, rugged hills, and chasms with waterfalls and rushing streams. He was something of a pioneer of these sites, more than thirty years ahead of the generation of Camille Corot (1794-1875), who frequented these places in his student days in the 1820s with other landscape painters from all over Europe. While in Italy Bidauld favored painting in the open air, and he produced numerous oil studies on paper, many of which featured in the sale of his estate. His studies usually are not rapid, broadly handled, and sketchy, like those of his contemporary Pierre Henri de Valenciennes, for example (1750-1819). But his careful rendering of detail reflects a patient study of nature, and he paid close attention to the effects of light. His nature studies never include figures--he preferred the effect of total solitude--and when he made more idealized landscapes for exhibition and sale, he generally had other painters add the figures. On his return from Italy, Bidauld exhibited five paintings at the Salon of 1791, and from this time on his career became more public. He contributed regularly to the Salon until 1844. Bidauld became a major practitioner of polished, idealized landscapes, epitomizing the neoclassical style. His fame was international, and in 1800 he received an important commission from Charles IV of Spain (r. 1788-1808) for four landscapes for the Casita del Labrador, part of the royal palace of Aranjuez. He enjoyed the favor of the French royal family until 1814 and continued to receive official commissions during the reign of Louis XVIII (r. 1814-1824). Throughout this time he provided the landscape settings for medievalizing \"troubadour\" subjects, and between 1817 and 1822 he painted a series of scenes from French history for the Galerie de Diane in the royal palace of Fontainebleau. He painted many views of the fashionable parks around Paris, such as Joseph Bonaparte's Mortefontaine and the marquis de Girardin's Ermenonville, where a celebrated monument to Rousseau had been erected. Bidauld's lifelong admiration for Rousseau culminated in 1822, when he acquired Mont-Denis at Montmorency, Rousseau's last home. By the time of his death in 1846, when the naturalism of the Barbizon school was on the rise, Bidauld's neoclassical and medievalizing works seemed conservative and even archaic.[Philip Conisbee, in French Paintings of the Fifteenth through the Eighteenth Century, The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue, Washington, D.C., 2009: 8.]",

    "biography": "Thomas Barker was born in Trosnant, Pontypool, in 1769, the eldest of the four sons of Benjamin Barker, a spendthrift who took to painting horses and who settled in Bath as a stable hand about 1783, and Anne, about whom nothing is known.   Thomas' youthful talent for drawing figures and sketching landscape attracted the notice of the predatory Charles Spackman, a wealthy coach builder and property developer, who had Thomas educated at Shepton Mallet Grammar School and took him into his own home. At Spackman's Thomas copied and imitated landscapes of the Italian and Flemish schools as well as those of Gainsborough, who had lived in Bath from 1759 to 1774.  Barker was entirely self-taught.  Spackman arranged an exhibition for his protégé in Bath in 1790; this proved profitable to them both.  Subsequently Spackman sent Barker to Rome for three years, where he studied assiduously, learning the art of fresco painting.  A second exhibition, including work sent back from Rome for Spackman to sell, was held in Bath in 1793.Returning to England in 1793 to find Spackman on the verge of bankruptcy, Barker established himself in London, showing at the Royal Academy of Arts scenes based on his Italian sketchbooks.  Achieving only a moderate success, he resolved to be a provincial painter and resettled in Bath in 1800.  In 1803 he married Priscilla Jones, with whom he had eight children.  Two of them, Thomas Jones and John Joseph were to become accomplished painters.  Barker built a fine house on Sion Hill with an art gallery where he held frequent exhibitions of his work, and he also gathered a fine art collection.Barker specialized in rustic genre paintings, fancy pictures, studies of local characters, and landscapes; he executed few portraits.  Such figure subjects as the Woodman (a variant on Gainsborough's theme) were so popular that they were widely copied on pottery, china, and fabrics.He exhibited chiefly at the British Institution, was well patronized by local collectors, and amassed a considerable fortune.  However, he managed his own affairs badly, and at the end of his life, as the prosperity of Bath declined, he fell on hard times.  He died at Bath on 11 December 1847.

    "biography": "Edward Savage was a self-taught painter and engraver who became proprietor of a paintings gallery and natural history museum in Philadelphia, New York and Boston.  Although his abilities improved, his talent never equaled his ambition.  Born in 1761 in Princeton, Massachusetts, he painted commissioned copies of portraits by John Singleton Copley and a naively painted full-length portrait of Abraham Whipple (United States Naval Academy, Annapolis) in the mid-1780's before making portraits of George and Martha Washington in New York in 1789-1790.  He went to London in 1791, where he published prints of his portraits of Henry Knox and Washington and had some contact with Benjamin West.  He returned to Massachusetts in 1794, painted portraits, and married Sarah Seaver of Boston.Savage went to Philadelphia in 1795, where from July he exhibited his panorama of London.  The following February he opened the Columbian Gallery, \"a large collection of ancient and modern Paintings and Prints.\" (Gazette of the United States, 20 February 1796).  From then until 1801 he worked in Philadelphia as a painter, engraver, print publisher and gallery operator.  Although his painting and engraving techniques had improved in England, he relied considerably on the assistance of his apprentice John Wesley Jarvis and English engraver David Edwin.  Later they and others claimed that their talents added significantly to the quality of Savage's work in these years.Savage exhibited his London panorama in New York in 1797 and moved there in 1801, where he reopened the Columbian Gallery.  He is listed in New York city directories through 1810 as a \"historical painter and museum proprietor\".  Gallery exhibits included his paintings of The Washington Family, Liberty, The Landing of Columbus (\"from a picture in the collection of the Grand Duke of Tuscany\") and his copy of West's Cupid Stung by a Bee.  Engravings of \"Liberty, Columbus, Etna, Vesuvius, a large whole length of Washington...and many other Prints published by E. Savage\" were for sale.  The museum offered natural history exhibits that were \"arranged, agreeably to the ideas of Sir Hans Sloane, and with the addition of a number of paintings, and other interesting articles, will form a complete source of amusement for every class, particularly the amateurs of Arts and Sciences.\" (The Daily Advertiser 10 June 1802).  Charles Bird King was a pupil in 1800-1805.  In the winter of 1805-1806 he and Charles Willson Peale exchanged natural history specimens.  The following summer he made a sketching trip to Niagara Falls.Savage went briefly to Baltimore in 1810, where he advertised as a portrait painter in March (American, and Commercial Daily Advertiser, 19 March 1810).  He moved that year to Boston, where he re-established the Columbian Museum on Tremont Street. He died seven years later, in 1817, on his farm in Princeton, Worcester County, Massachusetts.  One of many talented artists of the Federal period, Savage is best remembered as one of the first proprietors of a museum and picture gallery.

    "biography": "Charles Peale Polk was born in Annapolis, Maryland, on March 17, 1767, the son of Elizabeth Digby Peale and Robert Polk.  His mother was the younger sister of the celebrated artist and naturalist Charles Willson Peale, and when he was orphaned by the age of ten, Polk went to live in Philadelphia.  He was raised there by his uncle and received the same benefits of education and artistic training as his cousins.Polk's painting career was heavily dependant on his uncle's example, and his earliest dated paintings are copies of portraits by his uncle, which he made at the age of sixteen.  By the time he was eighteen the young artist had married and settled in Philadelphia, although he traveled to cities such as Baltimore, Maryland, and Alexandria, Virginia, to support his large family.  His early efforts seem not to have been fruitful; no works from this period have been discovered.  An advertisement from 1787 indicates that Polk solicited employment as a house, ship, and sign painter.By 1790 Polk was selling copies of Peale's so-called \"convention\" portrait of George Washington.  It was upon this model that Polk based his \"Princeton\" type of Washington portrait, of which he produced at least fifty-seven.  In 1791 he moved to Baltimore, where he had considerable success as a portrait painter for about five years.  The more than thirty-five portraits he painted on commission constitute the largest group of works by him from any period.  He supplemented his income by opening a drawing school in 1793 and 1974, and by starting a dry-goods business in 1795.  Within a year these ventures failed and in 1796 the family moved to Frederick County, Maryland.  Polk visited the surrounding counties to obtain business, made the acquaintance of James Madison, and in 1799 managed to obtain a sitting with Thomas Jefferson.As a strong supporter of Madison, Jefferson, and Republican policies, Polk hoped to obtain a government post in the Federal City.  He moved his family there in 1801 and in 1802 began working as a clerk-copyist in the Department of the Treasury, where he remained for the next two decades.  Although he produced few portraits in oil during these years, he made a number of miniature likenesses through a process called \"verre églomisé,\" which involved scratching a profile into gold leaf adhered to a glass plate, removing the leaf around the desired image, and painting the background black.With his third wife, the now part-time artist moved to Richmond County, Virginia, in 1820 and took up the life of a gentleman farmer.  He died there on 6 May 1822.",

    "biography": "Morland was born in the Haymarket, London, on 26 June 1763, the eldest of the five children of Henry Robert Morland and Jenny Lacam.  Educated at home, he took to copying pictures and plaster casts, and first exhibited (chalk drawings) at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1773, at the age of ten.  Apprenticed to his father in 1777, when he began copying in earnest, Morland worked hard for his father's profit, but was encouraged to advertise his talents.  His first picture to be engraved was published in 1780, he exhibited his first painting at the Royal Academy in 1781 (exhibiting sporadically thereafter, for the last time in the year of his death), and showed no fewer than twenty-six works at the Free Society of Artists in 1782.At the expiry of his apprenticeship in 1784, Morland refused an offer to join Romney's studio and entered the Royal Academy Schools; but after six months he left home and took lodgings close to a rapacious Drury Lane publisher, for whom he painted a large number of pictures.  In the summer of 1785 he worked in Margate as a portraitist and paid a short visit to northern France.  In 1786 he married Anne Ward.  Tragically, since he loved children, there was only one child, a still-born son.He established his reputation in the late 1780s as a painter of sentimental genre and of childhood subjects.  He turned to rustic subject matter in 1791.  Exhibitions of his work were held at Orme & Co. in 1792 and 1793, and at John Raphael Smith's gallery in King Street, Covent Garden, in 1793.  Morland did not normally work on commission, as his contemporaries did, but sold his paintings, which were mostly small in size, through an agent.  He had at least five pupils at different times, the principal ones facilitating his prolific production.As a reaction against a strict upbringing and the drudgery of his apprenticeship, Morland associated with the demimonde and soon acquired a reputation for recklessness and hard drinking.  After his marriage and early professional success he became more extravagant and more addicted to low and sporting company.  By 1789 he was seriously in debt and had to dodge creditors; in 1790 he settled in Paddington.  In 1793 he was warned by a physician of the dangers of further debauchery.  He was congenitally restless, and from 1794 on his debts compelled constant changes of address and greatly increased productivity.  In 1799 he visited the Isle of Wight; on his return, still in debt, he was arrested at his lodgings in Vauxhall and committed to the King's Bench, living within the rules of the prison until his release in 1802.  Morland spent his last years with his brother Henry, who had a picture shop on Dean Street in Soho.  Both his work and his health deteriorated--his pictures were only received at the Royal Academy on account of his former merit.  Worn out by his dissolute life, he died of brain fever in a spunging house in Coldbath Fields, London, on 29 October 1804.

    "biography": "Lawrence was born in Bristol on 13 April 1769, the youngest of sixteen children of Thomas Lawrence and Lucy Reade.  A boy prodigy without formal training, Lawrence was renowned by the age of ten for his profile drawings in pencil of the visitors to his father's hostelry, an established coaching inn on the London-to-Bath road.  After the family moved to Bath in 1780 he was taught by William Hoare and worked also in pastel.  In 1787 he settled in London, taking lodgings in Leicester Fields not far from Sir Joshua Reynolds, who encouraged him to use his studio for studying and copying.  He spent three months at the Royal Academy schools, chiefly drawing in the antique school, but gradually abandoning his practice in pastel to begin oil painting.Lawrence exhibited his first full-length portrait at the Academy in 1789, and his contributions the following year established his reputation.  In 1791 he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy, in 1792 he succeeded Reynolds as Painter-in-Ordinary to the King, and in 1794 he became a full Academician.  From 1793 he had pupils and studio assistants.In spite of his success, Lawrence was often in debt, mismanaging his financial affairs and living well beyond his means.  He moved in professional and theatrical circles, and became emotionally involved with two sisters, but never married.In 1814 Lawrence was commissioned by the prince regent to paint the allied heads of state and generals for what was to become the Waterloo Chamber at Windsor Castle, and in 1815 he was knighted.  He worked on this scheme in Aix-la-Chapelle and Vienna between 1818 and 1819, and went on to Rome (his first visit to Italy) to paint the Pope.  He returned to England in 1820, after staying nearly three months in Florence, to find himself elected president of the Royal Academy in succession to West.Lawrence worked unremittingly; there was a pressing demand for portraits from distinguished persons.  He was also an insatiable collector--one of the principal reasons for his financial difficulties--but his unrivaled collection of Old Master drawings, offered after his death to the king (at a bargain price) and, failing his acceptance, to the government, was refused by both and subsequently dispersed.  Lawrence died in London on 20 January 1830.  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "Although the Inventory of American Painting lists more than one hundred works by William Jennys and an additional eighty ascribed to him, there is surprisingly little known about this prolific artist's life.  He may have been the son, or perhaps the younger brother, of the portraitist Richard Jennys (active 1766-1801).  Both artists worked in New Milford, Connecticut, beginning about 1795 and William's earliest known paintings were produced there.  An advertisement which he placed in the Norwich (Connecticut) Packet in 1793, however, indicates that by then he was a practicing professional.In 1797 and 1798 Jennys worked in New York City.  After 1800 he traveled through New England, moving up the Connecticut River Valley to paint in Hatfield and Deerfield, Massachusetts, around 1801 and thereafter visiting Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Newburyport, Massachusetts, and several towns in Vermont.  He produced primarily waist-length portraits, and was known active through 1807.

    "biography": "John Johnston was born in Boston c. 1753, the son of engraver and decorative painter Thomas Johnston (c. 1708-1767).  Of four brothers who became painters, John Johnston was the most talented.  He was apprenticed after his father's death to coach and heraldic painter John Gore.  In 1773 he joined his brother-in-law Daniel Rea, Jr. in the painting firm of Johnston and Rea, a continuation of his father's business.  Account books of the firm (Baker Library, Harvard University Business School) indicate that much of his work was decorating clock faces, furniture, fire buckets, coaches, and other objects.  Johnston served in the continental army during the Revolutionary War, was severely wounded at the battle of Long Island in 1776, and was imprisoned by the British for about a year.  On his return to Boston, he continued the partnership with Daniel Rea until 1787, when he established himself as a portrait painter.By 1795 Johnston was renting John Smibert's former painting studio. He was one of the few portrait painters in Boston before Gilbert Stuart's arrival in 1805, and is listed as a portrait painter in Boston city directories through 1808.  His compositions derive from an already well-established tradition of Massachusetts colonial portraiture, primarily the work of John Singleton Copley.  Johnston died in Boston in 1818.

    "biography": "The third son of the five children of James Blake and his wife, Catherine, Blake was born near Golden Square, Soho, in London, on 28 November 1757.  He entered Henry Pars' drawing school in the Strand at the age of ten, was writing poetry by the age of twelve, and by the time he was twenty had produced some of the finest lyrical poetry in the English language.  In 1772 he was apprenticed for seven years to the successful engraver James Basire, who employed him between about 1774 and 1775 on drawing medieval tomb sculpture in Westminster Abbey for Richard Gough's Sepulchral Monuments in Great Britain.  In 1779 Blake was admitted to the Royal Academy Schools as an engraver, and he first exhibited there in 1780 a painting of an historical subject.In 1782 Blake married Catherine Butcher or Boucher; there were no children.  After the death of his father in 1784 he set up a print shop next door to his birthplace with James Parker, a fellow apprentice of Basire.  Blake was obliged for long periods of his life to make his living as a reproductive engraver, and he was regarded as such by most of his contemporaries.In 1788 Blake developed a process of etching in relief that enabled him to combine illustrations and text on the same page and to print them himself, thus ensuring complete independence of thought and expression.  Four illuminated books appeared between 1789 and 1794.  Many of his large independent color prints, or monotypes, were done in 1795.  From 1795 to 1797 he produced over five hundred watercolors for an edition of Edward Young's Night Thoughts, of which only one volume was published.In 1799 Blake was commissioned by Thomas Butts, a minor civil servant, to paint fifty small Biblical subjects, which he executed in tempera.  Butts, his single most important patron, seems to have bought the bulk of his output until at least 1810. In 1800, mentally exhausted, Blake moved to Felpham, near Chichester, at the invitation of the poet William Hayley, who offered him inconsequential employment for three years; there he regained a spiritual calm and was deeply affected by the study of Milton.  Returning to London he began Jerusalem in 1804, a project he worked on continually until his death, and executed for Butts a large number of watercolors of Biblical subjects, including illustrations to the Book of Job.  Between 1809 and 1810, enraged at being cheated by the publisher Cromek, Blake held an exhibition of his work, predictably a total failure with the critics and the public, at his brother's house in Soho, his birthplace.Neglected and in poverty, Blake was introduced in 1818 to John Linnell, who became his second major patron, commissioning a succession of works--including the engravings to the Book of Job (1823-1826), Blake's most popular work, and a set of illustrations to Dante's Divine Comedy (1824-1827)--and who made regular payments to him until his death.  In spite of Linnell's patronage, Blake was in considerable financial distress during his later years, and was obliged in 1821 to sell his entire collection of prints to Colnaghi's.  In 1822, at Linnell's insistance, he was the recipient of a grant from the Royal Academy.  He died of gallstones at his home in Fountain Court, Strand, London, on 12 August 1827.

",
    "biography": "The biography of Joshua Johnson published in 1992 by the National Gallery of Art in the systematic catalogue of its American naive paintings has been updated by new information published in 1996 by Jennifer Bryan and Robert Torchia.  Their article, \"The Mysterious Portraitist Joshua Johnson\" (Archives of American Art Journal, volume 36, number 2, 1996, 2-7), is the main source for the following biographical information about the artist.Joshua Johnson was rediscovered in the 1930s by J. Hall Pleasants, a Baltimore genealogist and art historian, who attributed thirteen paintings to Johnson and attempted to reconstruct his life and career on the basis of fragmentary and often contradictory information.  Among the many questions raised about the artist have been his race, his life dates, the spelling of his name (Johnson or Johnston), and essential details about his life.  Some of the speculation was finally dismissed when the Maryland Historical Society's Department of Manuscripts received three volumes of Baltimore County court chattel records, including registers of personal property transactions such as mortgages, deeds of gift, powers of attorney, bills of sale, and releases of slaves from bondage.One of these volumes contains the bill of sale and the manumission record of Joshua Johnson, and these prove conclusively that he was a mulatto, born in Baltimore around 1763.  He was the son of a white man, George Johnson, and an unknown black slave owned by a William Wheeler Sr.  The documents were recorded on July 15, 1782, and concern a slave named Joshua, \"now aged upwards of Nineteen Years.\"  The bill of sale records that on October 6, 1764, Wheeler had sold the child to George Johnston or Johnson (the document spells the name both ways) for 25 pounds, then about half the price of an adult male slave field hand.  In the manumission record, Johnson acknowledged that Joshua was his son, and arranged to free him when the young man completed his apprencticeship to Baltimore blacksmith William \"Forepaw,\" or when he turned twenty-one, whichever came first.  For the manumission to be valid, it had to be acknowledged before a justice of the peace, and in this case it was Colonel John Moale (1731-1798), a wealthy merchant-planter.  Joshua Johnson later painted a double portrait of Moale's wife and granddaughter, Ellin North Moale and Ellin North Moale (Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center, Williamsburg, Virginia).There is little surviving biographical information about the people mentioned in the documents.  William Wheeler Sr. lived from 1694 to 1767 and was a small farmer.  Nothing is known about Joshua's mother; no male slaves are recorded in Wheeler's will or inventory, although his will mentions two female slaves, one of whom had two children.  There is no known will or inventory left by George Johnson, nor does his name occur in Baltimore County land records.  He does appear in the 1773 tax list for Back River Upper Hundred in Baltimore County, living on Britain's Range, and he is listed in 1779 in the Baltimore County court minutes.  William Forepaugh, the blacksmith, was a member of the Mechanical Company of Baltimore in the mid-1760s, and fought in the Revolutionary War in Baltimore units.After Joshua Johnson received his freedom in 1782, he was listed as a portrait painter or limner in Baltimore city directories, beginning in 1796, through 1824.  He moved often, living mainly in the section of Baltimore where makers of painted chairs resided, suggesting that he may have supplemented his income by decorating furniture.  The National Gallery's portrait of Sarah Odgen Gustin is generally believed to have been painted by Johnson in Berkeley Springs, West Virginia, sometime between 1798 and 1802, and as a freeman he could have been an itinerant portraitist.  However, many of the sitters of portraits attributed stylistically to Johnson lived in close proximity to his places of residence.  There is no record of his training, nor is it yet known if he had direct contact with any of the artists linked to him by scholars, among them the Peale family of Baltimore, and the Connecticut artist Ralph Earl and his son, Ralph Eleaser Whiteside Earl.  He placed two advertisements in local newspapers, one in the Baltimore Intelligencer of December 19, 1798, in which he described himself as \"a self-taught genius\" who had \"experienced many insuperable obstacles in the pursuit of his studies,\" and the other in the Baltimore Telegraphe of October 11, 1802.Registers of St. Peter's Roman Catholic church in Baltimore likely refer to the artist, and indicate that he married his first wife, Sarah, in about 1785.  They had at least four children, two sons and two daughters; both daughters died young.  By 1803 a woman named Clara was Johnson's wife.  The painter was listed among \"Free Householders of Colour\" in the Baltimore city directory of 1817-1818, but does not appear in Baltimore records after 1824.  By 1825 he was living in Frederick County, Maryland, and within two years had moved again within the state, to Anne Arundel County.  Approximately eighty-three portraits are attributed to Johnson, and although they are difficult to date, none appears to have been done after his assumed departure from Baltimore.  As yet unknown is any information about his later activities, or where and when he died.",

    "biography": "Seven works by Jonathan Budington are known, dating from about 1796 to 1802.  The earliest, View of the Cannon House and Wharf, is inscribed Jonathan Budington Pinxt / John Cannon / 1792 and was probably painted for the son of John Cannon, Jr., a New York merchant living in Norwalk, Connecticut.  The other six are portraits: four signed J. Budington Pinxt in red paint, and two attributed to his hand.There were several Jonathan Budingtons in America at the turn of the nineteenth century.  One from Fairfield, Connecticut, is thought to be the artist because four of the seven works are portraits of residents of that town.  This Jonathan Budington was related to the sitters in  George Eliot and Family, one of the two attributed works, which lends further credence to the suggestion that he was the painter.Jonathan Budington of Fairfield, the son of Walter and Ruth Couch Budington, was baptized on 15 August 1779.  He married Sarah Peck Barnes, a widow, in 1820 and their only child was born the following year.  He died in New Haven on 21 January 1823 at age 43.No known documents indicate his professsion.  He may be the Budington noted by William Dunlap as having painted portraits in New York in 1798, and listed in New York City directories as a portrait painter from 1800 to 1805 and from 1809 to 1812, but New York portraits by his hand have not come to light.

    "biography": "Census records indicate that Frederick Kemmelmeyer was more than forty-five years old in 1800, and therefore born sometime prior to 1755, but no record of his birth has been found.  A Frederick Kimmelmeiger listed in naturalization papers issued at Annapolis, Maryland, on 8 October 1788 is presumed to be the artist.  He first advertised in the Maryland Gazette; or The Baltimore Advertiser on 3 June of that year, announcing his services as a drawing instructor, a painter of miniatures and larger pictures in watercolor and oil, and a sign painter.Kemmelmeyer lived and worked in Baltimore until 1803.  His journeys as an itinerant over the following fourteen years can be traced through his advertisements and portrait sitters.  In June 1803 he offered lessons in drawing, painting, and gilding in Alexandria, Virginia, where he opened a school the following September.  This was probably not successful, for he relocated across the Potomac in Georgetown in October.  He solicited western Maryland patrons in the Hagerstown and Frederick-town newspapers in 1805, then traveled north to Chambersburg, Pennsyvania, in 1806.  His advertisements appear in Winchester, Virginia, journals in 1810.  The following year he worked in Maryland, and two years later he taught and painted in West Virginia. By 1816, the year of his last known portrait and the latest advertisement discovered to date, he had returned to Hagerstown.Kemmelmeyer's known works include a few religious pictures, a number of pastel portraits, an oil painting of Martin Luther copied from a print, and historical compositions.  Kemmelmeyer's decision to paint historical scenes was unusual and ambitious for an untrained artist.  Choosing such subjects, particularly Washington, whom he painted at least five times, suggests awareness of the developing market for paintings of distinctly American themes.

    "biography": "Louis-Léopold Boilly was born in 1761 in the village of La Bassée, near Arras, the son of a woodcarver. From 1775 the boy lived in Douai with a relative, a prior of the Augustine order. It is not known who gave Boilly his first training. A very early practice of portrait painting, partly self-taught, seems to have launched him into his profession. By 1779 he was at work in Arras, busy with portraits. In 1785 he moved to Paris, where two years later he married Marie-Madeleine Desligne, the daughter of a merchant of Arras. His family portraits, conceived as intimate domestic scenes, attracted the attention of a provincial noble of literary bent, Calvet de La Palun, who commissioned him to paint a series of narrative genre subjects based on texts furnished by himself. From 1791 onward Boilly regularly exhibited portraits and genre scenes at the Paris Salons. When private patronage dwindled after the outbreak of the Revolution, he sought to reach a wider popular audience by painting boudoir scenes, of mildly licentious character, to be reproduced in quantity by the printmakers. A lukewarm supporter of the Revolution, he was denounced in 1794 to the Société Républicaine des Arts by a fellow artist, the Jacobin zealot Jean-Baptiste Wicar (1762-1834), for having painted \"obscene works revolting to republican morality.\" The denunciation was forwarded to Robespierre's Comité de Salut Publique. At the height of the Terror this was a life-threatening accusation, of which Boilly managed to clear himself by painting Triumph of Marat (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Lille), which appeased the revolutionary thought-police. His wife had meanwhile succumbed to the anxiety caused by these alarms. Remarried in 1795, Boilly benefited from the pacification resulting from the fall of Robespierre. The resurgence of luxury, corruption, and elegance in the years that followed brought him new patrons and supplied him with subjects for the kind of social observation that suited his temperament--amused, uncensorious, vividly pictorial, and often spiced with mild bawdiness and a touch of caricature. Besides episodes from the everyday of urban life (Queueing for Milk, Salon of 1796), he observed street crowds reacting to national events(Departure of the Conscripts of 1807, Salon of í8o8, Musée Carnavalet, Paris), sampled sidewalk entertaimllents (The Boulevard Prestidigitator, 1806), and surveyed the city's thriving prostitution (The Galleries of the Palais Royal, 1809, Musée Carnavalet, Paris).In his choice of subjects, he had an immediate French predecessor in Philibert-Louis Debucourt (1755-1832) with whose colored prints Promenade de la Galerie du Palais Royal (1787) and La Promenade publique (1792) he was certainly familiar. Debucourt's scenes of fashionable outdoor sociability in turn derived from Thomas Rowlandson's (1757-1827) Vauxhall, a print of 1784. In adapting these prototypes Boilly gave them a plainer middle-class aspect and treated them with a profusion of mundane detail that contemporaries criticized as \"Dutch\" and compared to the styles of Gerard Terborch II (1617-I68I), David Teniers II (1610-1690), and Gabriel Metsu (1629-1667). The factuality of his social and physical observation was, however, tempered by his invariable classicist embellishment of his young female figures, the hard distinctness of his colors, and the glassy smoothness of his brushwork.Portraiture, having launched him on his career, remained to the end his most dependable source of income.  His facility in executing small portraits rapidly and cheaply enabled him to be productive on an almost industrial scale, rivaling the output of the photographers of later generations. By 1828, well before the end of his career, he could claim to have painted more than five thousand portraits, each completed in about two hours. In searching for ways of capturing likenesses with speed, he tinkered with optical devices that, in turn, helped him to develop the illusionist techniques by which he brought off the spectacular feats of trompe-1'oeil still-life painting that astonished Salon audiences and irked the critics.Portrait painting influenced his treatment of genre subjects. His Meeting of Artists in Isabey's Studio (Louvre), which won success at the Salon of 1798, and his Studio of a Sculptor (1804, Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris), exhibited in 1804 as Picture of a Family, arranged actual portraits to form imaginary genre situations. Conversely, when composing his crowded urban genres he gave them the appearance of animated group portraits. But the portraitlike figures that fill his genre scenes--the attractive child, the fashionable young woman, the portly elderly bourgeois, and the grim-visaged street tough--are in fact only stock types from a repertoire to which he constantly returned.Boilly's work evolved very gradually from a classicizing Louis-XVI style to a French version of Biedermeier, always contemporary in subject matter and popular in tone but tending to mannerisms and repetitions that mitigated its underlying realism. Held in suspense by his contrary tendencies--to detailed surface realism on the one hand and embellishing stylization on the other--it underwent no radical changes: his later genre scenes, such as The Entrance to the Turkish Garden Café (Salon of 1812, private collection, Australia) or The Distribution of Wine and Food in the Champs-Elysées (Salon of 7822, Musée Carnavalet, Paris), still recall his work of the 1790s. Inevitably, they began to seem old-fashioned and by 1830 had entirely lost the flavor of modernity that had constituted their appeal.Boilly last exhibited at the Salon in 1824. Among the works of his old age was a series of lithographs of comical facial expressions, Grimaces. In the spring of 1828 he sold his collection of Dutch, Flemish, and French paintings and decorative objects, as well as thirty-seven of his own paintings. The monarchy of Louis-Philippe awarded him the cross of the Legion of Honor. He died in 1845, aged eighty-four.

    "biography": "Luther Adams Allen, a painter and musician, was born in Enfield, Connecticut, on 11 June 1780, the eighth child of the twelve children of Moses Allen and his first wife, Mary Adams.  By 1795, Luther Allen had traveled to Newport, Rhode Island, where he worked with the decorative painter, engraver, portraitist, and mathematical instrument maker Samuel King.  Allen remained in Newport for at least four years, and in 1799 he wrote a letter to his mother in Enfield explaining, \"I am now attending Mr.  King's Mathematical Instrument Shope [sic], as he has gone on a journey to Boston.\"  Allen porbably did not receive lessons in portraiture from King; his awkwardly drawn, loosely painted portraits show little evidence of such training.Allen returned to Enfield sometime between 1799 and 1801, when he advertised his services as an engraver, maker of portraits in oils, miniatures and pastels, and an ornamental painter with a wide range of skills.  He is also recorded as an accomplished violinist, a teacher of music and dancing, and the composer of a contradance tune, \"The Opera Reel.\"On 17 November 1803 Allen married Sally Pease Abbe of Enfield.  They had five children, the oldest four born in Enfield before 1812.  That year, or sometime later--the date has not been established--the Allens moved to Ithaca, New York, but documentation of Allen's activities there has not come to light.  On 27 November 1821, one year after the death of his wife, Allen died in Ithaca.

    "biography": "Rembrandt Peale, born in 1778 in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, was the son of Philadelphia artist and museum proprietor Charles Willson Peale, and his first wife Rachel Brewer.   He and his siblings, Rubens, Raphaelle, Titian Ramsay, Sophonisba Angusciola, and Angelica Kauffmann, were born during the most productive years of their father's painting career and were named after European artists.  Rembrandt was a precocious artist, painting his first work, a self-portrait, at the age of thirteen.  He continued to work as a portrait and history painter for almost seventy years, producing more than a thousand works.  His most original works date from the first three decades of the nineteenth century.Although Philadelphia was his home town, Rembrandt worked at various times in most of the other major eastern United States cities, including Boston, New York, Baltimore, Washington and Charleston.  As a young artist he benefitted from his father's friendships and patronage in Federal America.  He studied the work of contemporary painters, including Gilbert Stuart and Robert Edge Pine, as well as paintings by European artists that could be found in private collections.  His father made it possible for him to paint life portraits of George Washington (1795) and Thomas Jefferson (1800, 1805).  Charles Willson's ambitions also made him a museum director at times.  In 1795-1798, for example, he went to Charleston, Baltimore, and New York City to paint portraits and exhibit sixty copies of his father's museum portraits, painted by himself and Raphaelle.  In Baltimore in 1796-98 he managed the first Peale family museum outside of Philadelphia.  In 1798-99 he worked as an itinerant artist in Maryland.  In 1801 he assisted his father in unearthing the bones of prehistoric mammals in Newburgh, New York, and the following year he and Rubens took the skeleton assembled from these remains to England for exhibition.   From 1813 to 1822 he established and managed the Peale Museum in Baltimore.More than was true for his father, Rembrandt benefitted as an artist from extended periods spent in European capitals.  He studied briefly at the Royal Academy while in London in 1802-1803.  He travelled to France in 1808, and again in 1809-1810, painting portraits of French scientists, artists and writers in Paris for his father's collection of portraits.  His third European stay was in Italy, in 1828-1830, where he copied old master paintings for American collectors.  On his last European trip, in 1832-1833, he returned to England.  As a result, especially of the early trips, Rembrandt's style of painting changed, when he was still a young artist, from the tight, closely observed eighteenth century manner of his father, to a style strongly influenced by French neoclassicism and the work of Jacques-Louis David.  His first attempt at a grand manner history painting was The Roman Daughter (1811, National Museum of American Art, Washington, D.C.).  Even more ambitious was his enormous, multifigured painting of Court of Death (1820, The Detroit Institute of Arts), whose theme of individual choice in creating a happy and rational life expressed the tenets of the new, controversial religion of Unitarianism.  Next he turned his attention to creating a heroic portrait of Washington.  His result was the painting known from its inscription as the \"Patriae Pater\" portrait - Washington as Father of his Country (1824, United States Congress).  Later, in the 1840s, Peale returned to painting replicas of his portrait of Washington, capitalizing on the fact that he was the only living artist who had painted the first President's portrait at life sittings.While Rembrandt's ambitions and opportunities were very much derived from his father's energy and drive, the results and the context of his work was of his own generation.  After his trips to England and Paris, Charles Willson Peale turned to him to learn new techniques for painting.  His creation of an idealized portrait of Washington was a response to the nationalistic demands of the 1820s, marking the end of the Revolutionary era.  His subject pictures of the 1830s and 1840s reflected the sentiments of the Victorian era.   Peale also promoted his theories of art and its role in a democracy by publishing brochures, articles and books.  Some, like Description of the Court of Death; an Original Painting by Rembrandt Peale (1820), were written to accompany exhibitions of his work, held in several American cities.  Others, including Graphics; A Manual of Drawing and Writing for the Use of Schools and Families (1835) and Introduction to Notes of the Painting Room (1852), were intended as drawing and painting manuals for mechanics and art students.  He also wrote reminiscences of his life and family, poems, and accounts of his travels.  From 1855 to 1857 he offered a personal history of American art in his \"Reminiscences\" and \"Notes and Queries\" published in The Crayon, a popular art periodical.  He died in Philadelphia in 1860.

He is presumed to have received his initial painting instruction from his father.The earliest known portrait by Earl is dated 1802.  In 1804 he painted the ambitious family portrait in the National Gallery and several other dated works. These early efforts reflect his study of his father's compositions, yet they are characterized by figures with artificially erect postures and greater simplification of the body, most evident in the ovoid heads and cylindrical arms.Earl was soon to learn perspective, anatomy, and three-dimensional illusion.  In 1809 he journeyed to London, where he studied with John Trumbull and was advised by Benjamin West.  After a year in London, he moved to the residence of his maternal grandfather and uncle in Norwich.  He remained in Norwich for four years, receiving portrait commissions, notably from General John Money, his father's patron many years before.  Earl left England in 1814 and traveled to Paris.  He stayed nearly a year to study paintings at the Louvre, and made the acquaintance of John Vanderlyn.Inspired by the grand tradition of history painting he witnessed in Europe, Earl returned to the United States in December 1815 with ideas for a grand-scale historical composition.  Landing in Savannah, Georgia, he traveled about the southern states making portraits for inclusion in a portrayal of the battle of New Orleans.  Although he never completed this project, his experience in the South was valuable.  He established a reputation as a portraitist and met General Andrew Jackson, who was to become his lifelong patron and friend.Earl visited Jackson's home in Nashville, Tennessee, known as \"The Hermitage,\" in January 1817, and painted portraits of the general, his family, and friends.  He married Mrs. Andrew Jackson's niece, Jane Caffery, on 19 May 1819.  She died in childbirth the following year.After the death of Mrs. Jackson in 1828, Earl became the General's closest companion and lived at The Hermitage.  When Jackson was elected president, the artist accompanied him to the White House, where he was known as \"Court Painter\" and \"the King's painter.\"  Jackson returned to The Hermitage after his second term in office, taking Earl with him.

During this period he worked in Massachusetts (Weymouth, Hingham, Braintree, and Newton, 1803-1812; Weymouth again, 1815; Boston area, 1817), New Hampshire (Hopkinton, Hanover, 1813) and Maine (Bath, Paris, Portland, 1816; Bath, Bridgton, Phippsburg, 1817-1818).  He painted the members of many families that were related through intermarriage, and seems to have relied on word-of-mouth, rather than newspaper or other advertising, to obtain commissions.  To date there are fifty-six known works by Greenleaf, the majority of them reverse paintings on glass, painted in the profile format.Greenleaf's works are characterized by attractively subtle colors, well-proportioned features, and physiognomic accuracy.

    "biography": "Marshall was born in Seagrave, Leicestershire, on 8 November 1768, the fifth of the seven children of Charles and Elizabeth Marshall.  Nothing is known about the occupation of his parents or about his schooling.  In 1789 he married Mary Saunders of Ratby, who bore him four sons (two of whom died young) and three daughters.  Described in 1791 as being a schoolmaster, he left for London the same year to study painting with the portraitist Lemuel Francis Abbott, with whom, however, he stayed only briefly.  He is reputed to have taken up animal painting as a result of his seeing Sawrey Gilpin's Death of a Fox at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1793.Marshall first published an engraving of one of his pictures in the Sporting Magazine in 1796 (his work continued to appear there throughout his career, and sixty engravings had been published by 1832).  In these early years he secured royal as well as aristocratic patronage.  He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1800 and showed sporadically thereafter until 1819, chiefly portraits of racehorses and their owners; but he is reported to have despised the Royal Academy and its politics and never became an Academician.  In 1801 he took in John Ferneley as an apprentice for three years.  Although highly successful in London, from 1812 until 1825 Marshall lived in Norfolk, close to Newmarket, so that he could study the finest racehorses with greater ease.In 1819 he suffered severe injuries in a coaching accident; although it has been argued that this seriously impaired the quality of his later work, there is visual evidence that this was not so, and in 1820 he was sufficiently active to build a new painting room for himself at Newmarket.  From 1821 he was racing correspondent of the Sporting Magazine under the pseudonym Observator.  He returned to London in 1825 and settled in Bethnal Green, where he died on 24 July 1835.

    "biography": "George Ropes, born in Salem, Massachusetts, on 15 May 1788, was a deaf mute.  He was one of nine children of a sea captain, George Ropes, Sr., and Seethe (Millet) Ropes and had one sister who suffered from the same affliction as he.  The artist lived in Salem almost his entire life, except for the years 1798 to 1801, when his father decided to try his hand at farming in Orford, New Hampshire.  He was apparently not successful and brought his family back to Salem.The first reference to George, Jr., as a painter was in 1802, when he was only fourteen years old.  The diary of William Bentley, an indispensable document for any study of Salem history, states: \"Mr. George Ropes' dumb boy is very successful at painting.  He is instructed by Cornè, an Italian artist in Salem.\"  Michele Felice Cornè (1752-1845) was born on the island of Elba and came to America in 1799, settling in Salem until 1806, when he moved to Boston.  Cornè is known for portraits, landscapes, depictions of naval engagements, ship portraits, fireboards, and mural decorations.  Like his master, Ropes preferred landscape, ship portraiture, and marine subjects, but he is not known to have painted likenesses.  The young painter followed his teacher's example closely, copying Cornè's works directly on at least two occasions.  Although he never quite attained Cornè's proficiency, perhaps because his career was brief, his works at their best have sometimes been confused with his mentor's.In mid 1807 Captain Ropes died at sea, leaving George, Jr., to support the family.  To supplement his income, he took up sign and carriage painting, yet he continued to produce marine views and landscapes as well as paintings documenting events in Salem history.  George Rope's career was cut short by consumption, which took his life, at the age of thirty, on 24 January 1819.Many of Ropes' paintings have remained in Salem, where he is represented in the collections of the Peabody Museum and the Essex Institute.  His most successful works are treasured for their historical accuracy and wealth of minute detail.

    "biography": "Although born in England in 1780, John Wesley Jarvis was the son of an American mariner who moved his family back to the United States by the mid-1780s.  At the end of that decade, the Jarvises settled in Philadelphia, where the artist spent his childhood and began his artistic training.  He is known to have frequented the studio of the aging Matthew Pratt and he knew the Danish painter, Christian Gullager, but his formal instruction did not begin until around 1796, when he became apprenticed to Edward Savage.  Jarvis later claimed that he learned little from his disagreeable master; his time spent with David Edwin, an English engraver also employed by Savage, proved much more beneficial.Jarvis moved to New York with Savage by 1801, but within a year he was working on his own as an engraver.  In 1803 he entered into a partnership with Joseph Wood which lasted seven years.  Together they executed engravings, miniatures, and larger portraits.  Jarvis had learned the technique of miniature painting from Edward Malbone, and by the time of the Wood partnership, he was also producing his first oil paintings.  In addition, he operated a drawing school for a time and executed inexpensive silhouette portraits.In 1809 Jarvis married Betsy Burtis (who died four years later, leaving him with two children).  Within a year of his marriage, however, he parted with his family in order to seek portrait commissions in Baltimore.  Although he made occasional trips back to New York, he remained in Baltimore for several years.  While New York always remained his home base, he continued his habit of extended residences in other cities for most of the rest of his life.  During the 1820s and 30s, for example, he sought work in South Carolina, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Washington, Virginia, Ohio, and Georgia.  His apprentice, Henry Inman, probably accompanied him on these trips until his term of service ended in 1822.Jarvis had risen to the top of his profession in 1814, when he took over an unprecedented commission for six full-length portraits of the naval heroes of the War of 1812 for the City of New York (Gilbert Stuart had given up the important project after a dispute with the patrons).  For over a decade, he remained the premier portrait painter in New York, with important ties to the political, mercantile, and cultural elite.  Yet Jarvis was also something of a social outsider, known for his ostentatious dress, flippant manner, and propensity to consume alcohol.  He was celebrated as a hilarious story-teller, and his ties to the theater world were many.  As early as the 1820s, however, he received some personal setbacks; in 1823 he was sued successfully by his apprentice John Quidor for breach of contract, and the following year he lost custody of his children in a court battle with his estranged second wife.  A decade later, in 1834, he suffered a debilitating stroke while in New Orleans.  Partially paralyzed and mentally incapacitated, he spent the rest of his life in New York City, cared for by his sister, Elizabeth Child.  He died in 1840.

    "biography": "Turner was born on Maiden Lane in Covent Garden, London, in 1775 (the actual day is uncertain, but Turner maintained it was Saint George's Day, 23 April), the only son of William Turner and Mary Marshall.  His mother, who was mentally unstable, was committed to Bethlem asylum for the insane in 1800, and died in 1804.  During his only sister's fatal illness (she died in 1786) Turner was sent to live with his mother's brother in Brentford and attended Brentford Free School; this was his only formal education.  His early artistic talent was encouraged by his father, who exhibited his drawings in his shop window (the father remained a devoted supporter and, later, was his son's studio assistant and general factotum until his death in 1829).  In 1789, the year of his first  extant sketchbook from nature, Turner entered the Royal Academy Schools, also working at about this time in the studio of the architectural draftsman and topographer Thomas Malton.  He exhibited his first watercolor at the Royal Academy in 1790 and his first oil in 1796; thereafter he exhibited nearly every year until a year before his death.  He stayed with his father's friend, John Narraway, in Bristol in 1791, and from then on until the end of the Napoleonic Wars made frequent summer sketching tours in various parts of Britain.  In 1794 he published his first two engravings, and in 1798 began drawings for The Oxford Almanack.  Probably beginning in 1794 he worked for three years at Dr. Monro's evening \"academy\" in the company of Thomas Girtin, Edward Dayes, and others.Turner's precocity led to his election as an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1799, and to full Academicianship in 1802.  He revered the Academy all his life, was assiduous as a member of the council and hanging committee and as auditor of the accounts, and was proud to be appointed its professor of perspective in 1807, from 1811 until 1828 giving lectures that ranged widely over the problems of landscape painting.  He moved from Maiden Lane to lodgings on Harley Street in 1799, opening his own gallery in contiguous premises on Queen Anne Street in 1804; this he enlarged between 1819 and 1822.  In 1805 he took a house at Isleworth, keeping a second home on the riverside at intervals for the rest of his life (Upper Mall, Hammersmith, from 1806 to 1811; Sandycombe Lodge, Twickenham, from 1813 to about 1825; Cheyne Walk, from about 1846 onward).Turner made his first journey abroad in 1802, traveling through France to Switzerland, and studying in the Louvre on his return.  In 1817 he visited the Low Countries and subsequently traveled more frequently on the Continent (until 1845), less frequently in the British Isles (until 1831). Between 1819 and 1820 he paid his first visit to Italy, staying principally in Venice and Rome; he revisited Venice in 1833, 1835 (probably), and 1840.He worked continuously for the publishers of illustrated books; his illustrations appeared at intervals between 1827 and 1835.  Turner made his reputation as a topographical watercolorist, sketching from nature, mainly in pencil, the sketches serving as a repository of ideas of which he might make use months or even years afterward.  He was determined to raise landscape painting to the level of ideal art, closer in the hierarchy of genres to history painting, and he experimented first in watercolor then in oils with many new techniques.For some twenty years, from about 1798, he maintained a liaison with Sarah Danby, with whom he had two daughters, but he never married.  In old age, following the death of his father and close friends, he became increasingly pessimistic and morose, allowed the house and picture gallery on Queen Anne Street to become dilapidated, and finally lived largely in his cottage on Cheyne Walk, cared for by his housekeeper, Mrs. Booth.  There he died on 19 December 1851.  He was buried in Saint Paul's Cathedral, London.

    "biography": "Pierre-Paul Prud'hon was born in 1758 in the Burgundian town of Cluny, the son of a stonemason. Both parents died when he was very young. A Benedictine of the abbey of Cluny, Father Besson, befriended the boy and saw to his education. Supported by a recommendation from the bishop of Micon, Prud'hon was admitted to the provincial Academy of Dijon, then directed by François Desvoges, a competent painter. In 1778 he returned to Cluny to marry Jeanne Paugnet, the daughter of a notary, who was pregnant by him. The match was a miserably unhappy one from the start. Eager to escape, he obtained funds from a local amateur, Baron Joursanvault, that enabled him to continue his studies in Paris under the tutelage of Jean-Baptiste Pierre (1713-1780, First Painter to the king, who introduced him to a classicizing late rococo much influenced by Correggio. The Rome Prize of the Burgundian Academy, won in 1784, enabled Prud'hon to spend four years in Italy, where he developed a liking for the work of Leonardo.  In his classical studies he followed his preference for sensuous Hellenic grace, a taste that separated him from his more rigorously Roman or Spartan contemporaries. He returned to Paris in 1789 and there lived through the Revolution in poverty, earning a scant living with portraits and graphic work. Though a Jacobin and member of the revolutionary Commune des Arts, he sought no political office.To the Salon of 1793, at the beginning of the Terror, Prud'hon submitted erotic subjects, graceful allegories on the pleasures or torments of love, romantic in feeling and curiously unrevealing of the grimness of their time (The Union of Love and Friendship, 1793, The Minneapolis Institute of Arts). After Robespierre's fall (1794), he sheltered in the rustic security of a village in Franche-Comté, where he spent two years painting portraits (Madame Anthony and Her Two Children, 1796, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Lyon) and designing illustrations for the publisher Didot. After the establishment of the Directory (1795), he returned to Paris, coolly received by Jacques-Louis David and his followers. His design for a ceiling intended for the Louvre, Wisdom and Truth, Descending to Earth, Dispel the Darkness That Covers It (1799), hinting at peace and renewal after revolutionary strife, won him the commission and the privilege of lodgings at the Louvre. Though he was held in low esteem by David's faction, Prud'hon from this time on had to be reckoned with as a history painter. His aptitude for large-scale decorative work brought him the commission of a suite of allegorical wall paintings for the Hôtel de Lanois (1796-1799), the residence of one of the newly enriched financiers who set the tone of Directory society. Through his friendship with Nicolas Frochot, the powerful prefect of the department of the Seine, he received important commissions and was brought into the orbit of Bonaparte.In 1803 he separated from his mentally ill wife. Shortly thereafter a young painter, Constance Mayer (1775-1821), came into his life, at first as a pupil, then as his collaborator and intimate companion. Prud'hon by this time was receiving generous state commissions. After the establishment of the empire in 1804 he was in demand as portraitist for the imperial family (Portrait of the Empress Josephine, 1805, Louvre). He designed the decor of court celebrations, as David had once overseen the pageants of the Revolution, and was charged with the artistic detail of festivities and ceremonies, notably those accompanying Napoleon's second marriage, in 1810, to Marie Louise of Austria. At the request of Frochot he painted Justice and Divine Vengeance Pursuing Crime (1808, Louvre) for the courtroom of the Palace of Justice. The picture created a strong impression by its powerful depiction of Crime as a fugitive assassin when exhibited at the Salon of 1808, which also included a painting in Prud'hon's more familiar, sensuously ingratiating manner, Psyche Carried of by Zephyr (1808, Louvre).The fall of the empire, regretted by Prud'hon, did not impair his career, but his work now began to show signs of fatigue. In 1816, the year of David's exile, he was admitted to the Institute. His very existence was shattered in 1821 when Constance Mayer, who had been suffering from spells of depression, committed suicide in his apartment at the Sorbonne. Prud'hon survived this catastrophe by little more than a year, at work on a painting of Christ Expiring on the Cross (1821, Louvre), unfinished at his death, that he had intended as a monument to his grief. He left no pupils. Many of his paintings have suffered serious damage from his excessive use of bituminous paints. He is now most admired for his drawings, studies of the nude in black and white chalk on tinted paper, that rank, together with Ingres' very different drawings, among the high achievements of French classicism.

    "biography": "Jacob Eichholtz was born November 2, 1776, in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he spent much of his life.  His first drawing lessons were rudimentary, obtained from a sign painter.  He apprenticed with a copper and tinsmith before being hired as a journeyman to a master coppersmith in 1801.  He established his own business, working as a tinsmith until 1812, but sold this enterprise in 1815 to devote himself to painting.  Eichholtz was married twice, first to Catharine Michael Hatz, a widow with two children and with whom he had four children.  After his first wife's death Eichholtz wed Catharine Trissler of Lancaster in 1818, and with her had nine children.Eichholtz began painting portraits in profile as early as 1805.  In 1808 he met Thomas Sully, who was in Lancaster working on a portrait commission.  Eichholtz offered Sully the use of his \"painting room,\" and later described their interaction:\"Chance about this time threw a painter into the town of my        residence.  This in a moment decided my fate as to the arts.       Previous to the arrival of this painter, I had made some rude      efforts with tolerable success, having nothing more than a         bootjack for a palette, and anything in the shape of a brush, for at that time brushes were not to be had, not even in           Philadelphia.  At length I was fortunate enough to get a few       half-worn brushes from Mr. Sully, being on the eve of his          departure for England.  This was a great feast to me, and enabled me to go on until others were to be had (1809).\"           (Dunlap 1834: 2:385).  Later in this passage Eichholtz goes on the describe his early artistic efforts: \"Part of the day I wrought as coppersmith, the other part as painter.\"  A ledger recording his tinsmithing trade and other business from 1809 to 1817 is interspersed with entries for portraits.Eichholtz painted profile portraits throughout his career, but employed this format far less frequently after 1810.  An essentially self-taught painter, Eichholtz showed a marked progression in his technical skills throughout the 1810s and 1820s. While his early profile figures are simple and only somewhat painterly, the portraits that constitute the majority of his oeuvre (1810-1842) are more sensitive and thoughtful renderings, more mature in style.  Full-faced, these images are much richer in modeling and color, and recall Sully's style, but are less romantic then Sully's, grounded in an unpretentious realism.  His most ambitious compositions are those of the 1830s that employ elaborate backgrounds and accoutrements.  Although best known for his portraiture, he painted landscape and history subjects as well.In 1811, Eichholtz visited the painter Gilbert Stuart in Boston, and began to exhibit with the Society of Artists at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where he continued to exhibit until his death.  William Dunlap took note of the artist's success in Baltimore during an 1820 visit there.  Eichholtz often painted in that city, spending weeks at a time there on portrait commissions, and is also known to have worked in Pittsburgh and in Delaware.  By 1821 he was working in Philadelphia, where he lived for ten years before returning to Lancaster in 1832.  He died in there in 1842.

    "biography": "The son of a maker of carriage bodies, James Frothingham was born near Boston, in Charlestown, Massachusetts, in 1786.  Initially he worked in his father's shop, where he taught himself to paint the finished coaches.  He also experimented in sketching and is said to have received some instruction from Fabius Whiting, a younger artist based in Lancaster.  Frothingham began his training by painting portraits of family members; by about age 20 he had abandoned the carriage-making trade for full-time portrait work. During this early stage of his career he visited Gilbert Stuart, who was to have a profound influence on his later development. Although unimpressed by Frothingham's first efforts, Stuart eventually revised his opinion and encouraged the younger artist with periodic criticism of his portraits.  Frothingham became one of several artists to adopt Stuart's light-toned, freely brushed manner, and he often executed copies of his mentor's likenesses.After working for more than a decade in Boston and Salem, he moved with his wife and three children to New York City in 1826.  Soon he began exhibiting at the Boston Athenaeum (despite his recent move) and the National Academy of Design.  The latter institution elected him an associate member in 1828 and a full academician in 1831.  He served as its corresponding secretary in 1844.  Frothingham was particularly active during the 1830s, but his production fell off at about age 60.  He spent the last two decades of his life in Brooklyn, where he died in 1864.  His daughter Sarah became a painter of miniatures.  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "Thomas Sully was born in 1783 in Horncastle, Lincolnshire, England, the youngest son of nine children born to the actors Matthew and Sarah Chester Sully.  At the suggestion of his father's brother-in-law, a theater manager in Virginia and South Carolina, the Sullys emigrated to the United States in 1792.  Sully attended school in New York until his mother's death in 1794, when he returned to live with his family in Richmond.  From there they moved to Charleston, South Carolina, where the future artist performed on the stage with his parents and siblings.Following the example of his older brother, the miniature painter Lawrence, Sully resolved to become an artist.  He first received art lessons from his young schoolmate Charles Fraser.  After an unsuccessful attempt to learn the business of insurance broking, Sully was apprenticed to his brother-in-law, a French emigrée miniaturist named Jean Belzons.  After a violent quarrel with his teacher in 1799 Sully left Charleston and joined his brother Lawrence in Richmond.  Inspired by the sight of portraits by Henry Benbridge, he continued to study art and opened up his first studio at Richmond in 1804.  When Lawrence died in September 1804 Sully assumed responsibility for the family and eventually married his brother's widow Sarah.  In 1806 Sully accepted a commission to paint at a theater in New York, where he met William Dunlap, John Wesley Jarvis, and John Trumbull.  He invested one hundred dollars to have Trumbull paint a portrait of his wife so that he might learn something of the senior artist's technique.  In 1807 he travelled to Boston and spent about three weeks studying with Gilbert Stuart, who encouraged his efforts to become a portraitist. Later that year Sully moved to Philadelphia, where he remained for the rest of his life.His portrait practice flourished, and in May 1809 he entered into an agreement with a group of prominent citizens that enabled him to embark a year-long trip to study art in London.  Sharing a room there with Charles Bird King, he studied under Benjamin West and Henry Fuseli, met the circle of British artists who were active at the Royal Academy of Art, and familiarized himself with collections of old master paintings.  When Sully returned to Philadelphia in 1810 he quickly set about establishing his future reputation as one of America's foremost portraitists by painting a number of full-length commissions, beginning in 1811 with George Frederick Cooke in the Role of Richard III.  In 1812, one year after the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts acquired the painting, Sully was elected to an honorary membership in the organization, in which he played an active role until resigning from its board of directors in 1831.  From 1819 to at least 1846 he and his partner, the restorer and frame maker James S. Earle, ran a successful commercial art gallery.Sully's artistic activity was not confined to Philadelphia, and throughout his long career he made numerous protracted trips to Washington, Baltimore, Boston, New York, and West Point.  At the height of his fame in 1837 a Philadelphia association of British expatriates called the Society of the Sons of St. George sent him to England to paint a full-length portrait of the recently crowned Queen Victoria.  Sully's professional stature was such that he attracted many pupils, most notable among them Charles Robert Leslie, John Neagle, and Jacob Eichholtz; he also trained several of his children to become competent artists.  In 1851 he prepared a short practical guide for portraitists entitled Hints to Young Painters and the Process of Portrait Painting, which was revised in 1871 and published two years later.Sully was America's foremost exponent of the highly romanticized, painterly, and fluid style of portraiture practiced by the two contemporary British artists he had most admired during his year of study in England, Sir Henry Raeburn and Sir Thomas Lawrence. Although he painted many of the most prominent politicians, clergymen, and military heroes of his era, Sully's fame rests mainly on his exaggeratedly elegant and idealized portraits of fashionable society women, and, to a lesser extent, his sentimental group portraits of children and \"fancy pictures.\" Often painted with a nearly flawless mastery of technique, these ultra-refined images are fundamentally decorative, and the deliberately self-conscious affectations of the sitters create a sense of artificiality that precludes the achievement of any penetrating psychological insight into their characters.  This aesthetic, however, appealed greatly to the elite social stratum from which Sully drew his patrons, and earned him the status of being the most successful American portrait painter following the death of Gilbert Stuart in 1828, until his gradual decline in the 1850s.  Sully died in Philadelphia in 1872.  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "Born in 1780 in the southern French town of Montauban, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres had early instruction from his father, an artist in the town's employ. The boy showed a precocious musical and artistic talent. Aged twelve, he was enrolled at the Academy of Toulouse, under the painter Joseph Roques, a friend of Jacques-Louis David. Still uncertain of his vocation, Ingres kept up his musical interest, supporting himself by playing the violin in the theater of Toulouse. In 1797 he left for Paris to study with David who was then at work on his Battle of Romans and Sabines. Disputes at the time troubled the master's teaching studio. It contained, besides docile followers, some rough bohemians (Crassons) at war with fellow pupils of a royalist or Catholic bent (Muscadins). Keeping aloof from these factions, a handful of principled dissidents aspired to an art more pure and genuinely \"antique\" than David's. Steeped in early literature and archaic art, in Homer, Ossian, and the Bible, they made themselves conspicuous by wearing beards and Greek costume and were known derisively as Barbus or Primitifs. Though not himself a member of this group, Ingres sympathized with them, and in his own student work affected a severe linearity that implied a reaction against his master's more moderate classicism. David nevertheless recognized his talent and used him as his assistant in the execution of the Portrait of Madame Récamier. Admitted to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Ingres won the Rome Prize of 1801 with The Ambassadors of Agamemnon in the Tent of Achilles (Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris). While a shortage of state funds delayed his departure for Italy, he lived in a community of young artists housed in a disused monastery. Medieval sculptures in the Musée des Petits-Augustins, the salvage of churches pillaged during the Revolution, deepened his taste for early styles. His studies at the Louvre, where Napoleon had assembled masterworks of the early Italians and Flemings, offered him further alternatives to Davidian classicism. At the Salon of 1806 his originality as an exacting stylist was manifested in the three portraits of Philibert Rivière, Mme Rivière, and Mlle Rivière (Louvre) -intricately designed, nearly shadowless figures, formed of distinct areas of color. They were ignored by the critics, but a fourth painting, of commanding size, Napoleon on the Imperial Throne (Musée de l'Armée, Paris), scandalized them by its static symmetry and hard, \"Gothic\" artificiality.In 1806 Ingres finally took his place among the pensioners of the French Academy in Rome. He used the four years of his stipend to immerse himself in the work of the Renaissance masters, Raphael above all, but his eyes were also open to medieval and Byzantine art. Several masterly portraits mark the early years of his Roman stay, among them those of Mme Devauçay (1807, Musée Condé, Chantilly) and of François-Marius Granet (c. 1807, Musée Granet, Aix-en-Provence). Required to show proof of his progress, he submitted deeply calculated studies of the nude, finished off by the addition of narrative detail, Oedipus and the Sphinx and the \"Valpincon Bather\" in 1808 (both, Louvre) and Jupiter and Thetis in 1811 (Musée Granet, Aix-en-Provence).  After his stipend expired in 1810, he prolonged his stay in Rome by making portraits of its French administrators, among them that of his future patron and lifelong friend, Marcotte d'Argenteuil (1810, National Gallery of Art, 1952.2.24). He was among the painters charged with the decoration of the Quirinale Palace, chosen as residence for Napoleon's infant son, the king of Rome. His share consisted of two large paintings, The Dream of Ossian (1813, Musée Ingres, Montauban), a luridly romantic subject ill-suited to his talent, and Romulus Victorious over Acron (1812, Louvre), executed in tempera to simulate fresco and composed as a frieze recalling works by John Flaxman (1755-1826) in its two-dimensionality. Among his Napoleonic patrons was Caroline Murat, sister of the emperor and queen of Naples, for whom he painted the Grand Odalisque (1814, Louvre), a woman of the harem reclining in a posture reminiscent of David's Madame Récamier for which Ingres had painted the accessories. The steely finish and the extravagant elongations and sinuosities of this nude troubled the reviewers of the Paris Salon, where the picture was shown in 1819. Painted for his friend Marcotte at about the same time, but in a totally different style, the National Gallery's Pope Pius VII in the Sistine Chapel (1952.2.23) presents a modern scene in minute detail and with great painterly subtlety.In 1814 the collapse of the French government in Rome deprived Ingres of patronage and reduced him to making a meager living for himself and Madeleine Chapelle, his young bride, by drawing portraits of visiting foreigners. At this juncture, the fashion for small, genrelike paintings of historical subjects came to his aid. With his gift for minute execution, he composed scenes from the lives or legends of famous men with conscientiously researched detail. His painted anecdotes--Henry IV and the Spanish Ambassador (1817, PetitPal), The Death of Leonardo da Vinci (1818, PetitPal), and others of this kind--have the bright distinctness of manuscript illuminations. To the Salon of 1819 he submitted, besides the Odalisque of 1814, a scene from Ariosto, Roger Saving Angelica from the Dragon (Louvre), which made effective use of the contrast between the golden gleam of Roger's armor and Angelica's fleshy whiteness, highlit against the lugubrious darkness of cliff and sea. The critics were hostile, but the picture was bought by the State.In 1817 Ingres received his first major commission from the Restoration government then in the process of refurbishing churches neglected since the Revolution. It called for an altarpiece representing Christ Delivering the Keys to Saint Peter to be installed in the French church of Santa Trinita dei Monti in Rome (1820, now Musée Ingres, Montauban) and was followed in 1820 by an even larger charge, the execution of The Vow of Louis XIII (completed 1824) for the cathedral of Montauban, Ingres' native city. Drawing heavily on motifs from Raphael and carried out with the help of many model studies, these projects occupied him for nearly a decade. Ingres, who had meanwhile moved to Florence, in 1824 accompanied The Vow of Louis XIII to Paris, where it won a resounding success at the Salon. Long accustomed to critical abuse, he now became the object of flattering attention from an art administration that, threatened by the hostility of the younger artists and the rising tide of romanticism, needed a leader strong enough to take David's place. In this emergency, Ingres seemed--despite his eccentricities--a possible defender of the traditions of great art. Awarded the Legion of Honor and elected to the academy, he was persuaded to remain in France, where he opened a teaching studio in 1825 and became David's heir as the most influential teacher of the unruly young and groomer of Rome Prize winners. He may have been unaware of the strategy that had led to his elevation and was, at any rate, ill cast in the role of academician, being of independent mind and opposed to academic routine.Important official commissions now came his way. For a newly decorated gallery of the Louvre, he was assigned an ideologically significant subject, the Apotheosis of Homer (1827), which he conceived as an homage to classical authority and affirmation of the continuity of tradition. In two hundred drawings and more than thirty painted studies, he calculated every detail of the composition but curiously failed to consider its ultimate function as a ceiling panel.  At the Salon of 1827, it appeared as the conservative counterweight to Delacroix' anarchical Death of Sardanapalus (Louvre). Both pictures failed to please: Ingres' work was considered a bore, Delacroix', the ravings of a lunatic.The Revolution of 1830 found Ingres at his post as national guardsman, protecting, rifle in hand, the Italian masters at the Louvre. The liberal monarchy of Louis-Philippe gave him honors but little work. It named him president of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, but the great commission that occupied him in the 1830s, the Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian (1826-1834) for Autun cathedral, had been given him by the previous regime. He labored over it for nearly ten years, only to find that, when shown at the Salon of 1834, it was dismissed by the critics as outmoded in style and subject matter. Deeply angered, Ingres declared that he would never show his work in Paris again and departed for Rome to assume the directorship of the French Academy. His output during his six-year term at the Villa Medici was relatively small, culminating in two paintings, Odalisque with Slave, an oriental fantasy (1839, Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts), and Antiochus and Stratonice (1840, Musée Condé, Chantilly), painted for the duc d'Orléans, the king's eldest son. A classical subject staged with minute attention to archaeological detail, this picture was shown at the Palace of the Tuileries. Its popular success enabled Ingres to make a triumphal return to France.Much of his energy during the following decade was spent on the project of a large mural decoration on the themes of the Age of Gold and the Age of Iron for the château of the duc de Luynes at Dampierre. Begun in 1842, Age of Gold, which Ingres planned as an image of humanity's primeval existence in a state of ideal beauty, developed into a dreamlike congestion of nudes in an Arcadian setting. Discouraged after years of effort, he left the project unfinished in 1850 but returned to its subject in 1862, in a painting of small size (Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts). It was in several portraits of society wornen--Vicomtesse d'Haussonville (1845), Baroness Rothschild (1848), Madame Moitessier (1851, National Gallery of Art, 1946.7.18), Princesse de Broglie (1853), and Madame Moitessier Seated (1856)--that Ingres achieved the monumentality that had eluded him in work of wall-size dimensions.His wife's death in 1849 cast him into a depression that prompted him to resign his professorship at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, but his marriage in 1852, at age seventy-two, to Delphine Ramel, a relative of his friend Marcotte, revived his spirits and renewed his self-confidence. The government of Napoleon III commissioned him in 1853 to paint an Apotheosis of Napoleon I for a ceiling at the Hôte1 de Ville (destroyed in 1871) and honored him with a grand retrospective exhibition at the Universal Exposition of 1855. Like David, who in his old age had turned to erotic subjects, the aged Ingres showed a renewed interest in the female nude, causing him to revisit motifs from his own earlier work: Venus Anadyomene (1848, Musée Condé, Chantilly) completed a composition begun in 1808; La Source (1856, Louvre), a boldly frontal nude, was the reworking of a canvas begun in 1820; Turkish Bath (Louvre), finished in 1862 after changes of format and details, comprised in its crowded composition a repertoire of his earlier nudes.Ingres was eighty-two years old when he signed this picture. In the same year he was appointed to the French Senate. He died, after a brief illness in January 1867, aged eighty-seven and still in vigorous mental and physical health. Having all his life shown a dislike of the academy and an aversion to the Salon, he was adopted by the establishment in the latter part of his career and perversely miscast in the role of archconservative. As such he has long figured in the history of art, though his work proclaims him to have been a stylist of daring individuality, whose single-minded dedication to an ideal of beauty based on difficult harmonies of line and color, on the music of relationships, and the mathematics of form, assures him a place apart.

    "biography": "Jacques-Louis David was born in Paris in 1748, the son of an iron merchant who was killed in a duel (an unusual circumstance in his social class), when the boy was nine years old. His mother, Geneviève Buron, came of a family of builders and architects and was distantly related to the painter François Boucher (1703-1770). Under the guardianship of uncles on his mother's side, Louis received a sound classical education. His guardians wished to train him as an architect, but he insisted on being allowed to study painting. Following the advice of Boucher, he was placed in the studio of Joseph-Marie Vien (1716-1809), the leading promoter of the neoclassical reaction against the rococo. David's student work, strikingly rococo at first, was slow in adjusting to the ascendancy of classicism. He competed four times for the Rome Prize, beginning in 1771 with an awkward pastiche of Boucher (Battle between Mars and Minerva, Louvre); failing again in 1772 with Diana and Apollo Killing the Children of Niobe (lost), which enraged him to the point of threatening suicide; and still unsuccessful in his third try in 1773 (Death of Seneca, PetitPal). His fourth attempt, Antiochus and Stratonice (1774, Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris), finally won him the prize and gave the first indication of his turning to classicism. In Rome from 1775 to 1780, the overwhelming impression of the masters of the Italian High Renaissance and early baroque caused him to purge his work radically of all traces of the modern \"French,\" that is, rococo, manner. A visit to Naples in 1779 completed his conversion. Belisarius Begging Alms (1780, Musée des Beaux Arts, Lille), begun in Rome but finished after David's return to Paris, sums up, in the calm grandeur of its composition and the subdued harmonies of its colors, the gains of his Italian stay. Reports of his talent had preceded him to Paris. The French Academy hastened to admit him with the rank of associate. At the Salon of 1781 the exhibition of his Italian canvases produced a strong impression on critics and public. His marriage in 1782 to Charlotte Pécoul, daughter of the supervisor of royal buildings, brought him influence and financial security. Sponsored by Vien, he was admitted to full academy membership the following year, offering as his reception piece Andromache Mourning Hector (Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris). With its antique weapons, furniture, and architectural ornaments, it was the most consciously \"Greek\" of his works to this time.Awarded a royal commission to execute a painting on the subject of Horatius Defending His Son Before the People for the Salon of 1783, David delayed work on the project and, on his own responsibility, changed its subject to the Oath of the Horatii.  Deciding that he could carry it out only in Rome, David traveled to Italy with financial help from his father-in-law and there finished the picture in eleven months. Exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1785, its Spartan severity excited general admiration and founded David's reputation as France's foremost painter. He followed this success with a private commission for the financier Trudaine, The Death of Socrates (The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), which won praise at the Salon of 1787. His entry in 1789, Brutus in the Atrium of His House, after the Execution of His Sons (Louvre), based on a play by Voltaire, was, like the Horatii, a royal commission, but its moral lesson--that family ties must yield to the demands of patriotism--was stated with an unyielding hardness that foretold the Terror.Without professing any political ideology, David's pre-Revolutionary paintings merely celebrated civic virtue, but with a vehemence that later made them adaptable to partisan rhetoric.  Though little is known of his opinions before 1789, there can be no doubt that he greeted the Revolution with enthusiasm and constantly supported its most radical causes. His political activity was at first confined to the Academy, in which he became the leader of a dissident faction of junior members. By enlisting the aid of the Commune of Paris, then of the National Assembly, and finally of the Jacobin Club, he managed to dismantle the privileges of the academy one by one and, as a member of the Committee of Public Instruction in 1793, obtained the decree that abolished it altogether. An admirer and friend of Robespierre,, he voted for the beheading of the king and the queen (January and October 1793) and briefly presided over the Convention. During his years of Revolutionary activity, he did not produce moralizing history paintings, such as might be expected from an artist-legislator. His first service to the Revolution was to commemorate the Oath in the Tennis Court at the request of a Jacobin club in 1790. His drawing (Louvre) of that crucial meeting of the Third Estate in an indoor tennis court at Versailles, exhibited at the Salon of 1791, was to have been executed in a large painting paid for by public subscription, but the scheme failed and the canvas remained unfinished. As the leading member of the Committee of Public Instruction, David was in fact, though not in title, Robespierre's minister of the arts, to whom it fell to plan the huge national pageants that were the Revolution's chief means of mass indoctrination. He designed their settings of artificial mountains, symbolic sculptures, and monumental altars, sketched the costumes and organized the ceremonial for the Translation of Voltaire's Ashes to the Pantheon (1791), the celebration of the Mutinous Swiss Guards (1792), the Festival of Brotherhood (1793), and the Feast of the Supreme Being (1794), and volunteered to paint the memorial portraits of the Revolution's \"martyrs\"--Lepelletier de Saint-Fargeau (1793, lost), Marat (1793, Musées Royaux, Brussels), and Barra (unfinished, Musée Calvet, Avignon).When Robespierre fell in July 1794, David was denounced as \"tyrant of the arts\" and had to defend himself before the hostile Convention. Though he had earlier vowed, recalling Socrates, to \"drink the hemlock\" with his leader, he lost his nerve, lamely exculpated himself, and was spared the guillotine. Imprisoned for several months in 1794 and again in 1795, he was amnestied at the time of the establishment of the Directory. Feeling betrayed and blameless, he withdrew from the pitfalls of politics into the innocence of art: he felt the Revolution had distracted him from his true vocation, classical history painting. The years between Robespierre's fall (1794) and Bonaparte's rise (1799) were his interlude of artistic independence between two political engagements, a time to concentrate on matters of form and style.While still in prison, his thoughts turned again to themes from antiquity. Among them he found one that was applicable to France's present situation, the Sabine Women Stopping the Battle between Romans and Sabiner (Louvre), a scene of reconciliation. The picture, which occupied him from 1795 to 1799, marked a change in his attitude toward classicism. His earlier paintings, he now believed, were too harshly \"Roman\" and too physical in their display of muscular anatomies. In the Sabines he aimed instead for \"Greek\" purity. He disposed its main figures in a wide frieze, stripped them bare, and defined their smooth and slender bodies with clean contours. He exploited this refined classical manner in portraits of fashion leaders of post-Revolutionary society, among them those of Mme Verninac (1799, Louvre) and Mme Récamier (1800, Louvre).  Impoverished after years without adequate income, he made his peace with the new order. When the academy, which he had helped to abolish, was reestablished under a new name, he immediately became a member. At the same time, he organized his studio as a place of instruction through which in time some four hundred students passed, causing it to become, identified simply as \"the French School,\" a dominant force in European art for several decades.David first met Bonaparte in the winter of 1797 on the latter's return from his Italian victories. David was eager to ally himself with the hero of the hour, and Bonaparte, already preparing his ascent to power, sensed that the master propagandist might prove of future use. A life-size portrait was begun but remained unfinished. A closer relationship developed in 1799, after Napoleon, now titled First Consul, had become the dictator of France. In Bonaparte Crossing the Alps at the Saint-Bernard (1801; Versailles and studio repetitions), David celebrated the victo of Marengo, \"calm on a fiery horse,\" as Bonaparte himself had specified. When Napoleon made himself emperor of France in 1804, he appointed David his First Painter and commissioned him to commemorate the empire's inaugural ceremonies in four paintings of very large size. Only two, the Coronation and the Presentation of the Standards, were executed, before David's insistent demands for money and administrative power so irritated the emperor that he canceled the project.  David had witnessed the coronation in the choir of Notre Dame. In striving to give artistic form to a scene from modern life, he put aside his classicist preferences and followed the example of Rubens' Coronation of Maria de Médici (Louvre).  His innate realism was roused by the ceremonial: he found that crimson velvet and gold braid, though repugnant to strict classicists, \"offered opportunities to a painter,\" as did the pomp of monarchy to a former revolutionary. A masterly composition of splendid, painterly execution, David's Coronation (1805-1808, Louvre) remains the summit of modern history painting. The second canvas in the series, Presentation of the Standards (1808-1810, Versailles), which records the armies' homage to the emperor, proved less successful. After its exhibition at the Salon of 1810, David received no further state commissions. Lacking official employment, he reverted to classical subjects of his own choice, taking up again a monumental canvas, Leonidas at the Pass of Thermopylae (1812-1814, Louvre), that he had begun under the Consulate in 1799 but abandoned at Napoleon's prompting. At sixty-two, he was beginning to show signs of weariness. The robustly modern realism and the delight in fresh colors that Napoleon's commissions had stimulated hereafter found an outlet only in portraits, notable among them the National Gallery's Napoleon in His Study (1961.9.15), the private commission of a francophile Briton.After Napoleon's first abdication in April 1814 and the restoration of Louis XVIII, David remained undisturbed and was able to arrange a private exhibition of his Leonidas. In March 1815 Napoleon returned from Elba, swept away the Bourbon court, and reconfirmed David as First Painter.  David now signed a declaration of loyalty to Napoleon--an act of courage, since he foresaw the emperor's ultimate defeat. On the reinstatement of Louis XVIII after Waterloo, David was banished from France, together with other regicides who had opted for Napoleon.  He settled in Brussels in 1816 and, at sixty-eight, prepared for a new life. The portraits he painted in these last years prove his sense of composition and vigor of execution to have been almost undiminished. Not so his renewed attempts at classical subjects that, now entirely without ideological relevance, took the form of ingratiating erotic mythologies--among them Cupid and Psyche (1817, The Cleveland Museum of Art) and David's disastrous swan song, Mars Disarmed by Venus and the Graces (1824, Musées Royaux, Brussels). Preceded by much publicity, this painting, when shown in Brussels and Paris to more than twenty thousand paying visitors, dismayed both friends and foes by its feebleness. David ended his days in bourgeois comfort in Brussels, cared for by affectionate pupils and friends. A heart ailment brought on his death in December 1825. The revolutionary who had stage-managed the pagan funerals of Lepelletier and Marat was borne in solemn cortège to the church of Sainte-Gudule and given a Christian burial.

    "biography": "Two biographies of Théodore Gericault have been published by the National Gallery of Art in the systematic catalogue of its collection.  Both are given here.By Suzanne Glover Lindsay, in European Sculpture of the Nineteenth Century, published 2000:Gericault[1] is best known for his paintings, prints, and drawings. However, thanks to the plasticity of his forms in those media and a handful of reliefs and three-dimensional groups, he was repeatedly acclaimed for his great promise as a sculptor. That tantalizing prospect, however, was cut short by an early death at the age of thirty-two.The artist was born in 1791 in Rouen to wealthy middle-class property owners, who moved to Paris when Gericault was about five years old. He was a poor student at the Lycée Impérial, indifferent to most subjects except drawing and classics. Gericault père opposed his son's decision to pursue artistic training. However, thanks to his uncle's subterfuge and his mother's bequest, in 1808 the boy secretly entered the studio of Carle Vernet (1758-1836), a painter of modern military and genre subjects that featured Gericault's lifelong mania, horses; he officially acknowledged Vernet as his master two years later. In February 1811, he entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, listed instead as a student of Pierre-Narcisse Guérin (1774-1833). Within a few months, Gericault quit attending his master's studio regularly, and turned to intensive study of the old masters on his own, copying paintings at the new Musée Napoléon (an early phase of the Louvre), until he was permanently expelled from the museum for assaulting a fellow student there in May 1812. He nonetheless competed regularly in the Ecole competitions.Even during his student years, Gericault immersed himself as an artist and a citizen in the tumultuous events of the time, the twilight and aftermath of Napoleonic glory. Though he showed in only three Salons, his entries publicly stated a commitment to painting modern subjects. He made his debut in 1812 with the Equestrian Portrait of M. D*** (now known as Charging Chasseur [Musée du Louvre, Paris]), a dramatic monumental tribute to the Napoleonic epic. The painting won a gold medal but was not purchased by the state and triggered little critical discussion. Its later pendant in the Salon of 1814, the now-celebrated Wounded Cuirassier Leaving the Battle (Musée du Louvre, Paris), apparently fared no better with the critics and the new Bourbon government despite its subject, France's military losses under Napoleon. In the meantime, Gericault entered the political fray through the military. After avoiding the draft by \"buying\" a substitute three years before, in the spring of 1814 he joined the mounted Second Squadron of the Paris National Guard, then the First Company of Musketeers of the King that followed Louis XVIII into exile the following year, during the Hundred Days (March-July 1815), and was disbanded en route. Though accounts conflict, Gericault remained in hiding over those months, perhaps in Paris, despite Napoleon's law forbidding members of the royal household troops in or near the capital. With Louis' return to the throne in July, he resurfaced, was released from royal service that autumn, and became active in liberal artistic and military circles.Gericault competed unsuccessfully for the Prix de Rome, but went at his own expense in the fall of 1816. His Roman works reveal his profound response to the antique, the Renaissance, and modern life.  In early 1817, he executed studies for a monumental painting of the climactic feature of the Roman carnival, the riderless horse races on the Corso. The many preliminary works for the unfinished project reveal Gericault's conception of the subject as an epic, timeless frieze, a modern classic on canvas that invoked ancient sculpture, Renaissance frescoes, and baroque painting. He interrupted that stay to return to Paris by autumn, where he resumed a stormy liaison with his maternal aunt that remained a secret for decades.  Their union yielded a child; she gave birth to their unacknowledged son, Georges-Hippolyte, in August 1818.For the next two years, Gericault retreated into work for his third and final submission to the Salon, a huge canvas depicting a national scandal: the hardships of the crew of the French naval frigate Medusa, abandoned to a makeshift raft by its aristocratic officers who took the lifeboats. Shown simply as A Shipwreck Scene in the Salon of 1819, the painting won the artist a gold medal and a state commission for a religious work on the subject of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Gericault was disheartened by the government's response (referring the commission to the younger Delacroix) and by the critical reaction, which he found myopic for debating the painting's possible political content instead of its artistic merits. In April 1820 he and an artist friend, Nicolas-Toussaint Charlet (1792-1845), took the painting, commonly called Raft of the Medusa (Musée du Louvre, Paris), on public tour through Britain, where it was moderately successful financially and critically. Gericault flourished artistically in Britain. His work exhibited at the Royal Academy received warm praise, and he found congenial colleagues and patrons as well as new sources of artistic inspiration. Gericault stayed in Britain for almost two years. During that fruitful period he executed watercolors, a series of horse-racing paintings (such as Epsom Downs Race, Musée du Louvre, Paris), and his important published suites in the new medium of lithography depicting other modern subjects from everyday life.Gericault returned to Paris in December 1821 in declining health, which he aggravated by subsequent riding accidents. During those final years, the quantity of works he produced was small, but the power of the finished paintings--the ten portraits of the insane and the Lime Kiln--was compelling. Bedridden for most of 1823, he began studies for two projected modern history paintings, African Slave Trade and Opening of the Doors of the Inquisition. He died in January 1824. That autumn, after repeatedly failing while Gericault was alive, the director of the Louvre, the comte de Forbin, finally was authorized to buy Raft of the Medusa for the museum.Gericault's accepted works in sculpture number about nine reliefs and full-in-the-round groups; seven of these have been identified as extant. Several exist in multiple versions and in various materials.  Apparently, they were never publicly shown during the artist's lifetime, and were never considered fully completed. They range iconographically from classical mythological themes and equestrians to such modern subjects as wild animals and the Russian Czar Alexander.  Stylistically, some display an almost Phidian austerity; others, a baroque robustness. Their relationship to Gericault's two-dimensional oeuvre is unclear. There is a general kinship of subjects and style, but no apparent direct counterparts in the various media for these works, unlike his study maquettes of animals or figures. The chronology of the sculpture is still debated. The works themselves are poorly documented. Only one has been given a date in the early literature; Charles Clément ascribed a bas-relief c.  1819. Some modern scholars place the sculpture at the beginning and end of Gericault's career as episodic exercises; others cluster them after 1816, as evidence of an increasingly fertile and tragically interrupted experimentation.Gericault is consistently called a genius who died on the brink of full creative flower. His surviving works in every medium have always eluded categorization. Independent and undogmatic, he acted with both impetuous engagement and rigorous discipline, moved easily from classical to modern subjects, and integrated scrupulous preliminary studies with inspired invention, no matter the subject. He evolved a powerful coalition of solid draftsmanly structure, a light-catching, palpable three-dimensionality, and a painterly touch and palette. Gericault became one of the following generation's most haunting artistic paradigms, the ill-fated engaged genius. For many, his work signalled a brilliant path for the art of the future to negotiate between tradition and innovation.[1] In contrast to traditional and very recent sources, this spelling follows Philippe Grunchec and his adherents in giving Gericault's name without an accented \"e.\" The origin of the word is reportedly the river Ger in his native Normandy; family documents exclude the accent; and Gericault regularly signed his name without. However, apparently authentic signatures with an accent can be found on drawings and legal documents illustrated in Germain Bazin, Théodore Géricault.  Etude Critique, documents et catalogue raisonné, 7 vols. and appendix, 1987-1997, 1:figs. 60-67. For arguments against the accent, see Philippe Grunchec, Tout l'oeuvre peint de Gericault, Paris, 1978: 83; Philippe Grunchec, Master Drawings by Gericault, Exh. cat. International Exhibitions Foundation, Washington, 1985: 11; and Lorenz Eitner's letter to Suzannah Fabing dated 12 September 1990 (in NGA curatorial files). Dr. Eitner's work on Gericault is included in his volume of the NGA Systemtic Catalogue devoted to early nineteenth-century French paintings, published 2000.By Lorenz Eitner, in French Paintings of the Nineteenth Century. Part I: Before Impressionism, published 2000:Théodore Gericault was born on 26 September 1791 in Rouen to parents of the property-owning middle class. The family moved to Paris in about 1796. On graduating from the Lycée Impérial in 1808, he declared his intention to become an artist. The death of his mother the same year brought him an annuity that assured his future independence. Against his father's wish, he apprenticed himself to Carle Vernet (1758-1836), the fashionable painter of equestrian subjects, who allowed him the freedom of his studio but seems not to have given him any formal training. Feeling the need for a more disciplined education, Gericault in 1810 moved to the studio of Pierre Guérin (1774-1833), a rigorous classicist and conscientious teacher, who made an effort to put him through the routines of the academic curriculum.  Gericault proved to be a resistant pupil who kept up his attendance at Guérin's studio only for eleven months.  Few traces remain of his student work. After taking amicable leave of Guérin, he continued his training as his own master, setting up his easel in the galleries of the Louvre, which were filled with the art loot of Napoleon's campaigns. Reacting against Guérin's classicism, he copied paintings by the dramatic colorists of the Renaissance and the baroque, particularly Titian, Rubens, Van Dyck, and Rembrandt, and intermittently continued these private studies of the masters until 1815, when the allies stripped the Louvre of Napoleon's booty.At twenty-one, still a largely self-taught beginner, Gericault presented himself at the Salon of 1812, the last of Napoleon's reign, with his Charging Chasseur (Louvre), a dashing improvisation rapidly worked up into a picture of Salon format. Of provocative size, indebted to Antoine-Jean Gros (1771-1835) and to Gericault's recent impressions of Rubens, the Chasseur held its own among the Salon's grand performances and earned him a gold medal.  After this precocious success, he resumed his self-training. Renouncing the magnitude and drama of the Chasseur for the time being, he occupied himself with small-scale studies from life, of horses observed in the stables of Versailles and brightly uniformed cavalrymen.He witnessed the fall of the empire with seeming indifference and in the summer of 1814 enlisted in the Gray Musketeers, a royalist elite cavalry, more decorative than military. For the Salon that the Bourbon government hastily organized in the autumn of 1814, he reverted to heroic dimensions and the grand style with his Wounded Cuirassier Leaving the Field of Battle (Louvre), conceived as a pendant to the Chasseur, which was shown again on this occasion. The ponderous figure of the defeated soldier, modeled in intense, dark colors, marked his return to a style of calculated monumentality and heightened expressiveness.On Napoleon's sudden return from Elba in March 1815, Gericault rode in the escort that covered the flight of Louis XVIII. During the Hundred Days he lay in hiding. His work to this point had belonged to the current of national modernity that was one of the two main tendencies in French art of the time. After Waterloo, he seems to have concluded that this vein, inextricably involved with Napoleon's reign, was exhausted. He made an abrupt change in his work, not only abandoning modern military subjects but also radically altering his style. With sudden determination, he turned to classical themes and, in an effort to teach himself the art of composing ideal subjects, inflicted on himself the kind of academic regimen that he had earlier refused to accept from Guérin. He rehearsed the rudiments of figure construction and composition, taking his motifs from the repertoire of classicist stock types that he had shunned in his student days. But instead of becoming a conforming classicist, he ruthlessly distorted the neoclassical idiom in the act of appropriating it. Romantic in its intensity, bearing the stamp of Michelangelo rather than David, this highly personal version of classicism lent itself--better than the fluent realism of his earlier work--to resonant dramatic statements.In March 1816 he competed for the academic Rome Prize but failed the contest and decided to undertake the voyage on his own account. His Italian stay in 1816-1817 gave him profound impressions of paintings of heroic size that further stimulated his interest in problems of style and whetted his appetite for work on the wall-filling scale. The great enterprise of his Italian year was the project of a large Race of the Barberi Horses, suggested by an event of the Roman carnival that he had witnessed in February 1817. He began by recording the start of the race as he had seen it in the Piazza del Popolo, then gradually suppressed its picturesquely Italian features and transformed the modern scene into a timeless frieze of athletes struggling with horses.On returning to France in the fall of 1817, he abandoned this project but continued briefly in its direction with studies for a Cattle Market (Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts), conceived as a monumental battle between men and beasts. At the same time, he tried subjects of a more pointed contemporary significance, such as the murder of Fualdes, a sensational crime that he proposed to represent in the \"antique\" style.  Meanwhile his renewed interest in modern subjects led him to take up lithography, a process recently imported to France, in which he attempted to treat scenes from the Napoleonic Wars in an elevated style, without falling into the conventions of classicism.  The crowning result of these various efforts was the Raft of the Medusa (Louvre), completed in 1819, after an exhausting, yearlong struggle. The enormous canvas represents an episode of a recent shipwreck that had violently aroused French public opinion. The problem that Gericault set himself in composing his picture was to combine the immediacy of an eyewitness account with the permanence and stability of monumental composition. He thus sought to unite the two antithetical aspects of his art in a grand synthesis, reconciling historical realism with heroic generality: the modern shipwreck was made to echo Michelangelo's Last Judgment. At the Salon of 1819, the Raft of the Medusa, misinterpreted as an attack on the government, met with a mainly hostile reception.Disappointed and exhausted, Gericault \"renounced the grand manner to return to the stables\" (Gericault to Pierre-Joseph Dedreux-Dorcy, in Charles Clément, Gericault, étude biographique et critique, avec le catalogue raisonné de l'oeuvre du maître, 3rd ed., Paris, 1879: 104). He went to England in 1820 to exhibit the Raft, and under English influence renewed acquaintance with that essentially anticlassical tradition of modern genre to which Carle Vernet had once introduced him. He sketched fashionable horsemen, farriers, beggars, and the caged animals in the zoological gardens in a manner that, if it lacked some of his customary force, had gained in subtlety of observation and freshness of color.  A sporting picture of distinctly English inspiration, the Epsom Down Derby (Louvre), remained the only major painting of his year in Britain.  When he returned to Paris in the winter of 1821, his health had begun to fail. Repeated riding accidents, aggravating a tubercular condition, brought on a painful and ultimately fatal illness. As death approached, his work regained much of its former compact strength while retaining its newly won refinement of color. In the industrial landscape of the Lime Kiln and in the series Portraits of the Insane, painted in 1822-1823, he achieved a style that was both realistic and in the highest degree expressive. In the final stages of his illness, he was overcome again by his old ambition to give epic grandeur to a scene from modern life and, though helplessly bedridden, projected immense compositions of such controversial themes as the African Slave Trade and the Opening of the Doors of the Spanish Inquisition. His death on 26 January 1824, at thirty-two, cut short these last efforts.",

    "biography": "Approximately eleven portraits can be attributed to this unidentified painter.  His identification as The Conant Limner is derived from the last name of four sitters who constitute the largest family group by his hand.  The Conants lived in Sterling, Massachusetts, where several of this limner's works remain.  Although likenesses by this hand have turned up in other regions of Massachusetts, all may have originated in the vicinity of Sterling, in Worcester County.The Conant Limner is not known to have dated any works.  From the sitters' attire, consistent in style, it appears that the portraits were painted within a limited span of years.  The National Gallery likeness of Sophia Burpee Conant, datable to about 1813 on the basis of her biography, forms a reference point for dating the other portraits and the period in which the artist was active.Schematic shadows, such as those cast by lace collars, and simplification of form suggest that the artist, in addition to portraiture, perhaps painted signs or other decorative pieces.  The artist has sometimes been referred to as \"The Merrimac Limner,\" based on the single example in a private collection said to have been acquired in the northern part of the state in Ipswich.  The existence of the greater number of works from the central region of the state, however, suggests that the designation Merrimac Limner is inappropriate and may be misleading.

    "biography": "Beechey was born in Burford, Oxfordshire, on 12 December 1753, one of the five children of William Beechey and Hannah Read.  Both his parents died when he was young, and he was brought up by his uncle Samuel, a solicitor, who intended him for the law.  While articled to a lawyer off Chancery Lane he became acquainted with a number of students of the Royal Academy of Arts, gave up his articles, and entered the Royal Academy in 1772.  There is no evidence for assertions that he studied with Reynolds; Dawson Turner, who knew Beechey, states more plausibly that he studied with Johan Zoffany, but this could only have been before July 1772, when Zoffany left England for seven years' sojourn in Italy.Beechey first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1776, and exhibited thereafter almost every year until his death more than sixty years later; he also exhibited regularly at the British Institution (founded 1806).  In 1782 he moved to Norwich, where he remained until 1787; there he met his second wife (nothing is known about his first wife, who died sometime after 1784), Anne Phyllis Jessop, whom he married in 1793.  They had fifteen children.  Also in 1793 he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy and became Portrait Painter to Queen Charlotte.The 1790s marked the high tide of Beechey's professional success.  Later eclipsed by Lawrence, he and John Hoppner were then still dividing the public honors in portraiture with that brilliant young star.  In 1798, after painting his huge canvas of the king at a review in Hyde Park, Beechey was knighted and became a full Academician.  Although he fell from favor at court for a while in 1804, he continued to paint royal portraits and was later Principal Portrait Painter to William IV.  In 1836 he sold his collection of works of art and retired to Hampstead.  There he died on 28 January 1839.

    "biography": "Ezra Ames was born in Framingham, Massachusetts, in 1768, and grew up in what is now Wayland, Massachusetts.  However, he ultimately became closely associated with the city of Albany, New York, where he dominated portrait painting during the early decades of the nineteenth century.  Ames began his career in his home state; by 1790 he was living in Worcester, accepting nearly any job that came his way.  Besides the occasional miniature portrait, his commissions included the painting, lettering, or gilding of carriages, fire buckets, clock faces, fences, mirror frames, drums, sun blinds, ear trumpets, and various articles of furniture.  Little of this early work has been identified, however.By 1793, Ames had left Worcester for Albany, joining family members who had moved west several years earlier.  There he took on the same variety of odd jobs, dealing additionally in artists' materials on the side.  He found, though, that there was little artistic competition in the growing town (which became the state capital in 1796), and he gradually eliminated some of his craftwork as portrait commissions became more numerous.  In this he was greatly aided by his masonic connections.  An active freemason, Ames later served as the highly visible Grand High Priest of the Grand Chapter of New York State masons.  He also profited from producing a steady flow of masonic regalia and medals.As a painter Ames was not a consistent stylist, but his work generally owes the most to the example of Gilbert Stuart, whose portraits he occasionally copied and acquired.  Several compositions, such as his early group portrait, The Fondey Family (1803, Albany Institute of History & Art), stand out in his career as ambitious showpieces, but undoubtedly his greatest bid for national recognition was his portrait (no longer extant) of Vice President, and former New York State Governor, George Clinton.  Shortly after Clinton's death in 1812, Ames sent the portrait to the second exhibition of the Society of Artists of the United States in Philadelphia, where it surprised critics and received unusual acclaim.  It was honored by becoming the first work ever purchased by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.  Ames subsequently painted other versions of Clinton's portrait, notably the full-length likeness (1813) in the New York State Capitol.  He is also known to have executed a few landscape paintings at this time.For the most part, though, the artist's activities were restricted to servicing the portrait needs of the upper Hudson River Valley, particularly the state legislature and the still-powerful descendants of the original Dutch patroons.  While he made occasional trips to New York City and was elected an Honorary Member of that city's American Academy of Fine Arts in 1825, his financial base remained in Albany.  He took an active role in local affairs there, serving as the chairman of the Fine Arts Committee of the Society for the Promotion of Useful Arts when it was established in 1815, and as director and finally president of the Mechanics and Farmers' Bank of Albany.  At his death in Albany in 1836, he left a considerable estate worth $66,000, including over 50 of his own works that were auctioned by his family in 1842.

    "biography": "John Vanderlyn was born October 15, 1775, in Kingston, Ulster County, New York, the son of house and sign painter Nicholas Vanderlyn and his second wife Sarah Tappan; his grandfather was the Dutch immigrant and limner Pieter Vanderlyn (ca. 1687-1778).  After completing his education at the prestigious Kingston Academy he went to New York City and worked at an art supply and engraving shop.  He studied art at Alexander and Archibald Robinson's Columbian Academy of Painting.  Vanderlyn soon attracted the attention of Aaron Burr, who provided him with financial support and patronage for the next twenty years.  Burr arranged for him to briefly study with Gilbert Stuart in Philadelphia, and then sent him to Paris in 1796. Vanderlyn enrolled at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts under the history painter and portraitist Francois-Andre Vincent.  He copied works by the Old Masters at the Louvre, and met Robert Fulton, who stimulated his interest in panoramic painting.Vanderlyn returned to the United States in 1800, where he made sketches of Niagara Falls for a series of engravings, and practiced portraiture in New York and Washington.  In 1803 he returned to Paris in order to procure casts of antique statues for the newly founded American Academy of Fine Arts.  He met Washington Allston during a visit to London, and the two artists later traveled throughout Europe together.  In 1804 Vanderlyn painted his first historical subject, The Death of Jane McCrea (Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut), which had been commissioned by Joel Barlow to be used as an illustration for his epic poem The Columbiad.  In Rome he painted the powerful Caius Marius Amid the Ruins of Carthage (1807, The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco) which was awarded a gold medal and admired by Napoleon at the Salon of 1808. His Ariadne Asleep on the Isle of Naxos (1812, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts) was the first formal nude by an American artist.The artist returned to the United States in 1815, and exhibited his works in several major cities, where the Ariadne scandalized unsophisticated and prudish American audiences who were unaccustomed to nudity in art.  He settled in New York, and obtained permission from the authorities to erect a rotunda in City Hall Park where he planned to exhibit a large panorama of Versailles.  The venture failed, and the artist declared bankruptcy.  He spent considerable time and energy for the remaining years of his life in unsuccessful attempts to promote his panoramic views and regain control of the rotunda.  After receiving a prestigious commission to paint The Landing of Columbus for the U.S. Capitol Rotunda in Washington, D.C. in 1837, he went to Havana in order to sketch the appropriate topography and foliage.  Two years later he sailed for Paris to execute the painting, but work progressed slowly and rumors circulated that it was largely the work of assistants.  When the artist brought the painting back to his native country it received little attention.  His finances exhausted, Vanderlyn was forced to paint portraits in order to earn a living, and many of these late works are of extremely poor quality.  Shortly before his death he unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the Senate to establish a national gallery and art school. He died on December 23, 1852, at the age of seventy-seven, embittered, destitute and alone in Kingston.Vanderlyn was a proponent of the French neoclassical style well after it had exhausted its popularity.  The figures in his most significant historical and narrative subjects were derived from classical statuary.  At a time when most of his American contemporaries were attracted to the painterly style associated with London's Royal Academy, he worked in a highly finished manner, characterized by precise drawing and emphasis on human anatomy, that was promulgated at the Ecole.  Like Allston and Morse, his attempts to elevate the aesthetic sensibilities of his countrymen by exposing them to the traditions of formal European academic art were doomed to failure.

    "biography": "Ammi Phillips painted for more than fifty years, producing perhaps as many as two thousand portraits in so many disparate styles that his works were once thought to be by several different artists.  Currently about five hundred works can be attributed to him, most sharing the characteristics of plain backgrounds, strongly contrasting light and dark elements, and awkwardly articulated figures.Born in Colebrook, Connecticut, in 1788, Phillips traveled often through western Connecticut and Massachusetts and through New York state.  Advertisements in the Berkshire Reporter indicate that he was offering his services as a professional artist in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, as early as July 1809.  His earliest identified works, for example his full-length portraits of Charles Rollin and Pluma Amelia Barstow, painted in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in 1811, may have been influenced by Connecticut limners active in the late eighteenth century, particularly J. Brown (active 1806-1808) and Reuben Moulthrop (1763-1814).  By 1813 the artist and his wife were settled in Troy, New York, shortly thereafter moving to Rhinebeck.  The portraits of this period (1812-1819), all of which were executed in towns along the New York-Massachusetts border, were once given to a hand called \"The Border Limner.\"  They are distinguished by a light, almost pastel palette, three-quarter or occasionally full-length figures, faces with dark-lined eyes, and a primitive attempt at conveying volume.In the next decade Phillips' paintings show greater realism, deeper coloring, and increased sophistication. He evidences a new interest in costume that may derive from contact with the academic Albany artist Ezra Ames (1768-1836), who lavished attention on the shawls and lace in his women's portraits.During the early 1830s Phillips was located in Amenia, New York, and painted in nearby Clermont, Rhinebeck, Germantown, Pine Plains, and Northeast.  In 1836 he left for Kent, Connecticut, the town which gave its name to another distinctive period (1829-1838) of Phillips' career.  The work of the so-called \"Kent Limner\" was first isolated when a group of ancestral portraits were brought together for a 1924 summer fair in that town.  Among them were eight which shared markedly similar characteristics.After 1840, Phillips' portraits contain less costume detail.  These later paintings were apparently executed rapidly and with great assurance.  The last of Phillips' work, those of the 1860s, inevitably show the influence of photography.When the newly widowed Phillips was married to his second wife in 1830, the record listed his occupation as \"portrait painter.\"  Unlike many untrained portraitists who had to resort to other means to supplement their income, Phillips seems to have pursued a single vocation.  Although he and his family never settled in one town for any great length of time, he was far from a struggling itinerant.  He generally painted several members of the same family and through these connections seems to have had a steady flow of work.  He was known to the academically trained painter John Vanderlyn, who commented to his nephew on the profitable and socially advantageous aspects of Phillips' craft.A century after his death in 1865 in Curtissville, outside of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, Phillips was given his first one-man exhibition, followed by a major comprehensive show three years later.  Today he is recognized as the most prolific and one of the most important naive portraitists in nineteenth-century America.

    "biography": "Crome was born in Norwich on 22 December 1768, the son of John Crome.  He seems to have been uneducated, and in 1783 he was apprenticed for seven years to Francis Whisler, a house, coach, and sign painter.  His first sketch in oil dates from 1790, and about that date he set up a partnership with Robert Ladbrooke, sharing a garret with him; the young men sketched landscapes in and around Norwich and exhibited at the printsellers Smith and Jagger.  In 1792 Crome married Phoebe Berney; the couple had five daughters and six sons.  On marrying, Crome became a teacher.One of Crome's earliest mentors was William Beechey, who worked in Norwich from 1782 and 1787; as a young man he visited him frequently in his London studio.  But the person who helped him most significantly at the outset of his career was Thomas Harvey of Catton House, whom he met in about 1790.  Harvey was then in the process of building up a fine collection, notably Dutch landscape paintings but also including works by Richard Wilson and Gainsborough, all of which influenced Crome's work.Crome was largely instrumental in founding, in 1803, the Norwich Society of Artists (of which he became president in 1808), an institution at first primarily a forum for biweekly discussions on art.  The first exhibition of the society was held in 1805, and Crome contributed between ten and thirty works regularly every year until his death.  He first exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1806, but only showed there at irregular intervals; as he grew older he was an infrequent visitor to London.Crome's reputation was high throughout Norfolk, not only as a landscape painter but also as an enthusiastic drawing master.  Active also as a restorer and dealer, Crome had a shrewd business sense and made a comfortable living.  From 1801 until his death he occupied a good-sized house on Gildengate Street in Norwich, and collected pictures, prints, and books.  He visited Wales and the Wye Valley with Ladbrooke in 1804, but he made only one journey abroad, to Paris in 1814.  He died in his home on 22 April 1821; an exhibition of his works was held that autumn.

    "biography": "Born in East Bergholt, Suffolk on 11 June 1776, Constable was the second son of the six children of Golding Constable and Ann Watts.  He was educated at a private school in Lavenham and at the grammar school in Dedham, subsequently joining the family business, of which it was intended he would succeed as manager.  He learned the technique of painting from John Dunthorne (a local plumber and glazier who was an amateur painter), and was encouraged by Sir George Beaumont.  Staying with relatives at Edmonton in 1796 he met John Cranch, a mediocre artist whose style he imitated, and John Thomas Smith, the antiquarian draftsman, with whom he made drawings of picturesque cottages.  In 1799 his father gave him an allowance to enter the Royal Academy Schools, reluctantly consenting in 1802 to his becoming a professional painter.  That same year Constable showed his first landscape at the Academy (where he was to exhibit nearly every year until his death), and acquired a studio opposite the family house.  He spent summers in East Bergholt, sketching from nature, until 1817; in the autumn of 1806 he made a two-month visit to the Lake District.In 1809 Constable met and fell in love with Maria Bicknell, but he was unable to marry her until 1816 owing to the opposition of Maria's grandfather.  After the marriage the couple lived in London, first on Keppel Street, then, after 1822, on Charlotte Street.  The marriage, which was the prelude to Constable's finest work, was a deeply happy one, and there were seven children, to whom the artist was devoted; Maria's health was far from robust, however, and she died in 1828, a blow from which Constable never fully recovered.He was belatedly elected an Associate of the Royal Academy, but did not attain full Academicianship until 1829, an injustice that rankled.  Although Constable himself never left England, he had three works shown in 1824 in the Paris Salon, where they were acclaimed by the French artists and were awarded a gold medal.  This led to the sale in France of over twenty works and to demands for replicas--previously Constable had sold few of his pictures except to patrons who were already his friends.  He still depended on financial support, however, from the family concerns managed by his devoted brother, Abram.Constable found a retreat in Hampstead in 1820 and began his studies of clouds (or \"skying\") there the following year; in 1827 he bought the house on Well Walk, which remained his country home until his death.  After his marriage he returned to Suffolk less frequently, but became better acquainted with the south of England, visiting Salisbury, Brighton, Arundel, and Petworth at various times between 1824 and 1835.  All these visits, which enabled him to become familiar with the surrounding country, were productive of pictures.  In 1829 he embarked on the publication of English Landscape Scenery, with mezzotints by David Lucas.  In 1836 he delivered at the Royal Institution his celebrated series of lectures on the history of landscape painting.  He died at Hampstead on 31 March 1837.

    "biography": "Robert Salmon was born in Whitehaven, a port situated on the northwest coast of England. Although his artistic beginnings are unknown, his career can be divided into two periods. Between 1800 and 1828 he lived in England and Scotland, and his work faithfully recorded the environs of Liverpool and Greenock. Salmon's style at this time reflected the influence of Dutch maritime painters. In many of his paintings, he adopted the low horizon and clear, sparkling light effects typical of Dutch seascapes.After 1828 Salmon moved to Boston. Although he was regarded as an eccentric, solitary man, he was highly thought of as an artist, and he soon became a leading maritime painter in the area. His paintings were admired for their detailed panoramic views of Boston's wharves and shorelines. While in Boston, Salmon also worked in the lithography studio of William S. Pendleton with Fitz Hugh Lane, during which time his maritime paintings became a model for Lane's work.[This is an excerpt from the interactive companion to the videodisc American Art from the National Gallery of Art.]",

    "biography": "Lancelot-Théodore Turpin de Crissé, born in Paris in 1782 and scion of an ancient patrician family of Angers, was the son and grandson of high army officers who had earned a reputation for their publications in the military sciences but also cultivated the arts. His father, a gifted amateur, exhibited two paintings and several drawings of Roman views at the Paris Salon of 1787, anticipating what would become his son's artistic speciality. A devoted royalist, the elder Turpin emigrated in 1794, at the height of the revolutionary Terror, and died penniless in Philadelphia. His family meanwhile found shelter with relatives in Anjou, where his mother supported them by painting portrait miniatures. Returning to Paris, after the persecution of nobles had ceased during the Directory, the young Turpin was befriended by the comte de Choiseul-Gouffier who gave him the means for a period of independent study in Switzerland (1803). Turpin made his Salon debut in 1806 with a landscape composition based on a literary subject from Châteaubriand, Les Adieux de René à sa soeur, which won him a gold medal. During a stay in Rome and Naples in 1807-1808, he continued his studies of landscape and architectural views. Back in France, he entered the circle of Queen Hortense, stepdaughter of Napoleon, who recommended him to her mother, the ex-Empress Josephine, then in the midst of her divorce from the emperor and about to form her personal court at Navarre and Malmaison. Appointed as one of Josephine's chamberlains in 1810, Turpin, \"homme doux, agréable et de bonne compagnie,\" (Laure Junot, duchesse d'Abrantés, Histoire des Salons de Paris, Brussels, 1838: 5:251) remained in her service until her death in 1814 and is believed to have become her lover.  The fall of Napoleon in 1814, followed shortly by the death of Josephine, freed Turpin of his court functions and enabled him to devote himself to painting.He had meanwhile married (1813) and been rendered financially secure by a large inheritance from a cousin, the marquis de Lusignan. Held in high esteem by the Bourbons, who knew him to be a loyal partisan of the dynasty, despite his past attachment to a Napoleonic court, he had no difficulty in establishing himself with the Restoration government.  Made an honorary member of the Academy in 1816 and appointed to the Conseil des Musées, he served in the Commission des Beaux-Arts and in 1825 was elected to the Legion of Honor. A frequent exhibitor at the Paris Salons from 1806 until 1835, he traveled in Italy in search of picturesque motifs in 1818 and again in 1824 and 1830.When the Bourbon government was brought down by the July Revolution of 1830, Turpin resigned his state functions and retired to private life in his native Angers to devote his remaining years to the formation of a collection of antiquities and works of art. In 1850 he bequeathed his collections to Angers, where they are housed in the museum that bears his name. He died in Paris in 1859.

    "biography": "Matthew Harris Jouett was born April 22, 1788, near Harrodsburg, in what became Mercer County, Kentucky.  Except for a few trips outside the state in search of commissions, he would reside virtually all of his life in Kentucky. His father, Captain Jack Jouett, was known as the \"Paul Revere of the South\" in honor of his 1781 ride warning Southern patriots of the approach of the British.  Only able to afford an education for one of his eight sons, Captain Jouett allowed his children to make the choice, which fell on Matthew. Although he studied law at Transylavania College in Lexington, Kentucky, Matthew subsequently abandoned the legal profession in favor of painting, leading his father to remark, \"I sent Matthew to college to make a gentleman of him, and he has turned out to be nothing but a damned sign painter!\"Jouett was married in 1812.  He served in the Kentucky Volunteers during the War of 1812, rising to the rank of Captain.  He became known for his charcoal sketches of fellow officers, which were admired for their precise verisimilitude.  At the end of the war Jouett accepted responsibility for the loss of $6,000 worth of payrolls and other papers that had been in his care, even though they disappeared during battle.  He would work to repay this debt for much of the rest of his life.Although Jouett's reputation as a portraitist was such immediately after the war that he began to receive regular offers of employment, he decided he needed further training.  In 1816 he went to Philadelphia, and then on to Boston, where he studied with Gilbert Stuart for four months.  Stuart considered Jouett, whom he called \"Kentucky,\" his favorite pupil, and conveyed to him the essentials of his late style of painting.  In particular, Jouett adopted Stuart's use of heavy shading and little or no background detail.  Jouett kept a meticulous journal while studying in Boston, a document that remains one of the main sources of information about Stuart's methods.Jouett returned to Lexington following his study with Stuart, established a studio, and began a busy practice as a portrait painter.  He is believed to have completed more than three hundred portraits before his death at age 39.  His primary concern was to capture his sitters' faces as accurately as possible, and the results were often direct and candid.  His insistence on truthful portrayals led him to dismiss one friend who sat for his portrait dressed in outlandish clothing and to refuse the request of a small child who wanted the color of her eyes changed.  Most of Jouett's portraits were bust-lengths of prominent Kentuckians such as Governor Isaac Shelby, Senator John Brown, and Henry Clay.  He also completed a full-length portrait of the Marquis de Lafayette (Kentucky Historical Society) and copies of famous paintings such as Gilbert Stuart's Atheneum Washington.Some of Jouett's late works are characterized by a slightly softer use of line and more chiaroscuro, which may reflect a knowledge of Thomas Sully's style gained from a visit to Philadelphia in 1823. Generally, however, his style remained consistent until his death on his farm near Lexington on August 10, 1827.

    "biography": "Eugène Delacroix was born in 1798, the son of Charles Delacroix who had served briefly as minister of foreign affairs under the Directory and who was on a mission to Holland, as the ambassador of the French Republic, at the time of his son's birth. His mother, Victoire Oeben, was descended from a family of artisans and craftsmen. Both parents died early, the father in 1805, the mother in 1814, leaving Eugène in the care of his older sister, Henriette de Verninac, wife of a former ambassador to Turkey and minister-plenipotentiary to Switzerland. The fall of Napoleon's empire spelled the temporary ruin of this family of high officials, and with it that of young Delacroix. But the influential relations among which his birth and childhood had placed him were to protect his subsequent career, particularly in those periods, after 1830 and again after 1850, when Bonapartist interests were on the rise. As a child he had played on the knees of Talleyrand, his father's successor in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a family friend. It has been suggested, but not proven, that Talleyrand, to whom Delacroix in later life bore a marked facial resemblance, was in fact his actual father.In 1815 Delacroix, aged seventeen, began to take painting lessons from Pierre Guérin (1774-1833) through whose studio Théodore Gericault had briefly and turbulently passed a little earlier. Guérin was a tolerant teacher who attracted the sons of the middle class. His classicist instruction had little effect on Delacroix; it was less important for his development than the literary education that he had received at the lycée. The example of Gericault with whom he was acquainted and for whose Raft of the Medusa (Louvre) he posed in 1818 left its mark on him, but in every essential respect he was, like many of his contemporaries, a self-taught artist, whose real school was the Louvre, where, even after the removal of the Napoleonic loot, the splendor of Titian, Veronese, and Rubens shone brightly enough to eclipse the school of David. Among his fellow copyists in its galleries he met the young Englishman Richard Parkes Bonington (1801-1828) who, together with his friend Raymond Soulier, was to introduce him to watercolor painting and a British tradition of colorism, and who helped to awaken his interest in Shakespeare, Byron, and Scott, the main literary sources of his romanticism.Delacroix' student work did not show extraordinary promise, but in 1822 his Salon debut, the Bark of Dante (Louvre), attracted some attention. Though it has a deserved place in the history of art, as the start of a great career, it is still an immature effort, heavy-handed in its combination of reminiscences of Gericault, Rubens, and Michelangelo, and incoherent in its composition. Two years later, his Massacres of Chios (Louvre) burst upon the Salon of 1824 as \"a terrifying hymn in honor of doom and irremediable suffering\" (Charles Baudelaire, \"L'Oeuvre et la vie d'Eugène Delacroix,\" published as L'Art romantique, Paris, 1869). The picture's resonant harmonies gave an early indication of Delacroix' mastery of color, and its lustful stress on horror and death struck a note that was to sound throughout much of his subsequent work. The government's purchase of the work enabled Delacroix to visit England in the spring and summer of 1825. He had already seen landscapes by John Constable (1776-1837) in Paris while at work on Massacres of Chios. Further impressions of English art and literature gathered during his months in London were to influence him in the following years, as is evident in his Portrait of Baron Switer (1826, National Gallery, London), a bravura performance in the manner of Thomas Lawrence (1769-1830), and in his use of subjects from Scott and Byron. His Execution of the Doge Marino Faliero (1826, Wallace Collection, London), based on a play by Byron and painted with something of Bonington's nervous brilliance, is the crowning achievement of his English phase.After these paintings of exquisite finish and relatively small format, the colossal, orgiastic Death of Sardanapalus (Louvre), shown at the Salon of 1827, came as a shock to the public. Delacroix had taken the subject from a play by Byron but supplied the voluptuous cast of this scene of slaughter from his own imagination. He paid for his audacity with a temporary loss of official favor. The following years were a difficult but productive period during which he experimented with a variety of subjects: studies of lions and tigers, oriental scenes, sensuous nudes, and turbulent battles.The Revolution of 1830 inspired his one truly popular work, Liberty Leading the People (Louvre). In the place of the febrile romanticism of his paintings of the 1820s, he now used a larger, more sober manner and colors of muted intensity. Dealing with this modern subject he achieved poetic effect without morbidity or false grandeur: even Liberty, abundantly physical, has the effect of adding a note of actuality rather than allegorical artifice to the tumult on the barricade. For once, public and critics united in praise of the artist, and the government of Louis-Philippe awarded him the Legion of Honor.In early 1832 Delacroix visited North Africa in the suite of a French embassy to the sultan of Morocco. Islamic Africa surpassed all his expectations. The classical beauty for which he had vainly looked among the plaster casts in Guérin's studio he now encountered along roadsides under the African sky. He filled sketchbooks with observations of Arab life and gathered a store of ideas that served him for the rest of his life. On his return to Paris, he began a series of oriental subjects, not Byronic fantasies now but recollections of actual experience. Algerian Women in Their Apartment (1834, Louvre) records his recollection of a visit to a harem with the quiet authority of fact rather than the fictions of romantic exoticism. The sensuous intensity of the painting results from stylistic means that seem simpler but are in fact more complex than those that produced the sensational Sardanapalus. It signals the attainment of his mature style, quieter but grander than his earlier manner, more monumental yet no less expressive, more restrained but more powerful.Early in his career, Delacroix had been hailed by the young French romantics as their leader. During the 1830s he outgrew this affiliation, not because he had changed his course, but because his fellow romantics were failing to keep up with him.  The \"romantic battle\" had been won too easily. After 1830 French romanticism became popular and died. Its followers, agreeable but minor talents for the most part, rapidly declined into picturesqueness and mannerism. Delacroix, by contrast, increasingly identified himself with the grand traditions of the Venetians and Flemings, withVeronese and Rubens above all. His later works expressed a growing concern with traditional subject matter and monumental form. In his Entry of the Crusaders into Constantinople (Louvre), shown at the Salon of 1840, he resumed compositional devices that he had used earlier in Massacres of Chios, but the former violence is stilled by the somber harmony of the colors and the weight of the great colonnade that dominates the scene. In his Justice of Trajan (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Rouen) shown at the same Salon, an even more elaborate architectural setting contains, with its strong verticals and diagonals, the animation of the figures.Behind Delacroix' new concern with compositional structure and balance lay the experience he had gained in carrying out the architectural decorations that occupied him during the latter part of his life. The governments of Louis-Philippe and Napoleon III favored him with important monumental commissions, beginning in 1833 with the allegorical decorations of the Salon du Roi in the Palais Bourbon (Chamber of Deputies). This was closely followed by the even larger enterprise of the Palais Bourbon's library (1838-1847), where Delacroix covered a succession of domes and pendentives with scenes celebrating the heroic lineage of the arts and sciences, in a dramatic succession beginning with Orpheus' gift of civilization to mankind and ending with Attila's destruction of Italy.  Before this was finished, he received the further commission of decorating the library of the Senate in the Luxembourg Palace (1840-1846), where, in the central dome, he painted the presentation of Dante to Homer and the other great men of Greek and Roman antiquity, to symbolize the meeting of the classical pagan with the modern Christian culture. There followed the ceiling of the Galerie d'Apollon in the Louvre (1850-1851), the decorations in the Salon de la Paix of the Hôtel de Ville of Paris (1852-1854, destroyed in 1871), and the Chapel of the Holy Angels in the church of Saint-Sulpice (1854-1861). No other painter of the time was so continuously employed in monumental work on the grandest scale, none was given such opportunities to triumph in public on ceilings, domes, and walls. His murals, exceptional achievements in a time when monumental painting languished, prove that this nervously frail artist had the energy to compose on immense surfaces and the mental vigor to invent images that dominate those walls. His superiority rested in part on his mastery of color that provided both the emotional force and the formal structure of his murals, in part on his command of expressive pantomime, of the movement, tension, and clash of bodies.  He was the most versatile of the painters of his time, including in the range of his subjects battlefield and barricade, Faust and Hamlet, royal tiger and odalisque.The Universal Exposition in 1855 showed thirty-six of his paintings, a tribute to him (together with Ingres) as one of France's two preeminent living artists. Having long been denied admission to the Academy, of which he privately took a coolly realistic view, he was at last admitted to this body of distinguished mediocrities in 1857. Frequently ill with bronchial infections and economizing his physical strength, he lived a frugal bachelor's life but worked with unabated energy until the end. For all his courtesy, his person could command awe and, on occasion, a secret terror.  In one of his last works, the National Gallery's Arabs Skirmishing in the Mountains (1966.12.1), he remembered once more his African voyage, the great adventure of his early years. He died, not long after completing this painting, on 13 August 1863. [This is the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

Nothing is known of his education or training, but he assisted in his father's work and turned to etching as a result of his enthusiasm for Piranesi.  In about 1804 he went to Chester as a drawing master, and from 1810 onward he published several series of etchings of ancient castles and abbeys, town houses, and picturesque cottages.  A sketchbook dated 1821 documents travels in North Wales, Warwickshire, Derbyshire, Durham, and Yorkshire.  Cuitt returned to Richmond perhaps in 1821 and built himself a house in Masham.  He resumed view painting and published several more sets of etchings, including one of Yorkshire abbeys.  His etchings were collected into one volume by Nattali, to whom he had sold the copyright, and published in 1855.  Cuitt died in Masham on 15 July 1854.

    "biography": "The son of a farmer, Francis Alexander was born in Killingly, Connecticut, on February 3, 1800.  During the winters of his eighteenth and nineteenth years he earned a small sum teaching in the local school and at the age of twenty used it to seek instruction in New York City.  He studied for several weeks with Alexander Robertson, but was forced to return home for lack of funds.   After executing a number of commissions locally, he made a second visit to New York, at which time he copied paintings by John Trumbull and studied the arrangement of colors on Gilbert Stuart's palette.  Alexander painted many portraits on his return to Connecticut, two of which were sent to Providence and resulted in an introduction to Mrs. James B. Mason, his future friend and patron in that city.Alexander lived in Providence in 1823-1824 and apparently had settled in Boston by 1825.  In that city he sought the advice of Gilbert Stuart, who offered him encouragement.  Alexander was also associated with the Pendleton lithographic firm, where he made some of the earliest portraits in stone, according to Harry T. Peters.Between 1825 and 1831 Alexander's portraits commanded increasingly higher prices.  By the time he left Boston for his European tour of 1830-1831, he had already painted such famous sitters as Noah Webster and President Andrew Johnson.Most of Alexander's time abroad was spent in Italy and included several months in Rome during which he lived with Thomas Cole.  It was in Florence in 1832 that Alexander met Lucia Swett, whom he married four years later.Upon his return to Boston in 1833, Alexander exhibited thirty-nine of his works at the Harding Gallery and was for a time quite successful.  He was made an honorary member of the National Academy of Design in 1840 and in 1842 painted Charles Dickens during the author's American tour.  In the later 1840s and 1850s, however, his commissions began to decline.  Perhaps because of this, or for health reasons, or for the musical education of his daughter, Francesca, Alexander and his family left for Europe in 1853.  Except for a brief visit to America in 1868-1869 the rest of their lives were spent in Italy, where Alexander abandoned portraiture and became a collector of early Italian paintings.  He died in Rome on March 27, 1880.  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "A native of the island of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, Frederick W. Mayhew was born in Chilmark on 6 July 1785.  Although Mayhew has been known for some time through his works, several of them signed, the biographical details of his life eluded scholars until recently.  Difficulty arose from his misidentification as Nathaniel Mayhew and confusion with other Frederick Mayhews from both Martha's Vineyard and mainland Massachusetts.Mayhew married Zelinda Tilton on 10 April 1802; the couple's one child was born in 1812.  He and his wife moved to Morgan (now Noble) County, Ohio, to join some of Zelinda's relatives after 1830.  Mayhew died on 17 October 1854 and is buried in the Tilton family cemetery in Cambridge, Ohio.Mayhew's known works are all portraits dating from his years on Martha's Vineyard, where island lore holds that he mixed Gay Head clay with dogfish oil to make his paint.  He may have painted landscapes after moving to Ohio; the History of Noble County describes him as a landscape painter and a sailor.

    "biography": "Bonington was born in Arnold, near Nottingham, on 25 October 1802, the only child of Richard Bonington and Eleanor Parks.  Nothing is known of his schooling, but he is reputed to have been skilled at drawing from a young age and to have loved acting.  In 1817, as a result of the social unrest affecting business following the introduction of the factory system into the Nottingham lace and hosiery industries, the Boningtons emigrated to France and set up a lace manufactory in Calais, moving to Paris the following year.  Bonington learned the art of watercolor painting, his response to nature, and a taste for coastal scenes from Louis Francia, a native of Calais, who had worked for sixteen years in England; he studied in the atelier of Baron Gros at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, Paris, from 1819 to 1822, where he was taught precision drawing.In 1821 Bonington made an extended tour of Normandy in the company of a fellow student, Alexandre-Marie Colin, and exhibited at two Paris dealers watercolors that were admired by Corot, Delacroix, and Gros himself.  He first exhibited at the Salon in 1822.  Bonington toured Belgium in 1823 and spent much of 1824 at Dunkirk, exhibiting his first oils at the Salon that year.  In 1825 he visited London, where he studied the Meyrick collection of armor together with Delacroix, whose studio he shared for several months on his return to France.Bonington traveled in Italy for eleven weeks in 1826 with Baron Rivet, a wealthy patron whom he had met through Delacroix, spending a month in Venice where he worked with feverish energy.  The rest of his short life was taken up with handling a mounting pressure of work, much it commissioned, in the face of increasing weakness induced by tuberculosis.  At the end of 1827 he moved from his studio in the house of Jules-Robert Auguste, a wealthy collector of oriental costume and armor, to a larger one in the rue Saint Lazare.  Bonington made visits to London to see his dealers in 1827 and 1828, exhibiting at the Royal Academy of Arts in both years and first showing his courtly history subjects there and and at the Salon in 1828.  Obliged by ill health to cancel a summer sketching trip in Normandy with Paul Huet, he later returned to London and died there on 23 September 1828.

    "biography": "The artist and inventor Samuel Finley Breese Morse was born in 1791 in Charlestown, Massachusetts, the eldest son of Reverend Jedidiah Morse and Elizabeth Ann Breese.  Morse's intellectual outlook and future commitment to cultural nationalism was deeply influenced by the orthodox Calvinist millennialism and evangelism he inherited from his father.  He began to paint portraits in the naive style characteristic of the Connecticut School while attending Yale University.  After graduation he moved to Boston and became the private pupil and friend of Washington Allston, who introduced him to a traditional program of academic study that encompassed drawing, anatomy, and art theory.  With Allston's encouragement he went to London in 1811, where he met Benjamin West, befriended Charles Robert Leslie, and was accepted as a student at the Royal Academy of Art.  Morse's first major painting, The Dying Hercules (1812-13, Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven), was a fairly competent attempt at the neoclassical history painting that was in vogue among Academy painters.Full of optimism, the young painter returned to America in 1815 with expectations of establishing himself as a professional artist. The unsophisticated cultural atmosphere was not conducive to his aspirations, and Morse was forced into earning a meager living as an itinerant portraitist, active in New England, Charleston, South Carolina, and New York.  He suffered a major disappointment when his painting The House of Representatives (1822-23, The Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.), envisioned as a touring picture for public entertainment, was a critical and financial failure. Morse's perseverance was finally rewarded in 1824 when he won the most prestigious commission of the decade to paint the full-length portrait The Marquis de Lafayette (1825-26, City of New York) when the French hero was on his triumphal tour of America.  The successful completion of this important portrait gained Morse the recognition and professional eminence he had sought for a decade, and designated the apex of his career as an artist.An educated, eloquent, and tireless crusader on behalf of artists' rights, in 1826 Morse used his new prestige to lead a group of young artists who seceded from the moribund American Academy of Art and founded the progressive National Academy of Design; he served as its first president until 1845.  The foundation of this new organization, which was dedicated primarily to art instruction, led directly to an efflorescence of American art, and a new generation of painters and sculptors made their debuts at its annual exhibitions.  In 1826 Morse delivered a series of four important lectures at the New York Athenaeum in which he argued for the advancement of art in American society.In 1829 he embarked on a three year grand tour of Europe, where he studied and copied works by the old masters in the museums of      France and Italy.  This period culminated in the large Gallery of the Louvre (1832-33, Terra Museum of American Art, Chicago), a pictorial summation of European art with which he hoped to improve American culture after his return to New York in 1832.  Despite its favorable reception among the intelligentsia, the painting failed before the general public.  Morse was further humiliated in 1837 when the Congressional Committee on Public Buildings decided not to commission him to paint a mural for the Capitol Rotunda.  This rejection may in part have been brought about by Morse's reputation for radical politics; in the middle 1830s he became associated with the Native American party and wrote several widely-read and vitriolic anti-Catholic diatribes whose xenophobic tone bordered on paranoia.  Disillusioned by failure, Morse ceased painting in 1837 at the age of forty-six, and devoted the last thirty-five years of his life to perfecting the electromagnetic telegraph.  He died in New York in 1872.Strictly as an artist Morse did not exert a major impact on the stylistic development of nineteenth century American art, and his ideas and art appealed exclusively to the cultural elite.  Well before his death Morse's invention of the telegraph had eclipsed his early renown as a painter, and it was only after the retrospective exhibition of his work held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1932 that interest in his art revived.  With the exception of the romantic Lafayette portrait, his most ambitious works failed before an unreceptive public.  Unable to earn a living through painting historical subjects he was forced into portraiture, and many of these paintings are of negligible quality. It was as a founder and first president of the National Academy of Design that Morse did much to advance art in America.

    "biography": "Little is known about James Peale because his career was overshadowed by that of his famous older brother, Charles Willson Peale (1741-1827).  Born in 1749 in Chestertown, Maryland, the son of an English immigrant schoolteacher, he became a journeyman in Charles's Annapolis saddelry in 1762, and several years later he began an apprenticeship as a cabinet maker.  After his older brother returned from London in 1769 as a fully trained artist, James became his assistant and pupil.  During the American Revolution he served as a first lieutenant in General Smallwood's Maryland regiment in the Continental Army, and retired at the rank of captain in 1779.  James settled in Philadelphia and lived in his brother's household until 1782, when he married Mary Claypoole, the sister of the engraver and portraitist James Claypoole Jr.By the middle 1780s he had established himself as an accomplished painter of miniature portraits, a field that Charles ceded to him by a special agreement in 1786.  A surviving sketchbook indicates that by the late 1780s he became interested in landscape subjects; his early examples of this genre are topographical and reveal familiarity with British artistic conventions.  When his eyesight weakened around 1810 he abandoned miniature painting and began to specialize in large portraits and still lifes.  James exhibited still lifes at the Pennsylvania Academy between 1824 and 1830.  Late in life he resumed his interest in landscape painting, and these works reveal a heightened romanticism.  Three of his daughters were noted artists.  He died in 1831.Until the early 1790s James's oeuvre bore the unmistakable imprint of Charles, but thereafter he developed a more fluent, painterly, and colorful style.  James is now recognized as the most skilled miniature painter of his era, one of the founders of the American still life tradition, and an important pioneer in landscape painting prior to the emergence of the Hudson River School.

    "biography": "Thomas Chambers was born in London in 1808 and emigrated to the United States in 1832.  A painter of both landscapes and marine scenes, Chambers did not confine his artistic subjects to views that he knew firsthand but made liberal use of both his imagination and popular engraved images.  Chambers is known to have looked not only to the Englishman William H. Bartlett's views, executed for Nathaniel Parker Willis' volume American Scenery (London, 1840), but also to Asher B. Durand's and Jacques Gerard Milbert's prints as the basis for several of his compositions.  A number of Chambers' depictions of naval battles during the War of 1812 are based upon engravings, at least two from prints after Thomas Birch.For the years 1834 and 1840 he was listed as a landscape or marine painter in the New York City directory.  From 1843 to 1851 he lived in Boston, then moved to Albany, where he remained until 1857.  He was subsequently listed in city directories in New York, 1858-1859; Boston, 1860-1861, and New York again, 1862-1866.  After this time there appears to be no record of him, and his death date is unknown.

    "biography": "William C. Bonnell, a Hunterdon County, New Jersey, portrait painter, was born on 1 February 1804 in the town of Clinton.  He was the fourth child and second son of Colonel Clement du Mont and Rachel (Wolverton) Bonnell, and the grandson of the Revolutionary War Colonel Abraham Bonnell.  Abraham was the proprietor of the Bonnell Tavern, the first place in the region where minutemen were recruited.  This tavern was inherited and operated by Clement, who left it to William.  It remains in the Bonnell family.On 9 June 1836 William married Margaret Hinchman (1813-1901); they had two children.  The Bonnells belonged to the Bethlehem Presbyterian Church in the nearby town of Grandin, and when William died on 12 October 1865, he was buried in the church graveyard.The only records of William's career as an artist are the approximately twenty paintings that have been discovered to date.  Many are inscribed on the reverse in large handwriting with his name and the date, and some include the name of the sitter. Chustetunk's Frosty Ferris, an unsigned picture of a hunting dog, is thought to be one of his earliest efforts.  The first signed and dated works are companion portraits from 1823.  A tavern sign from the Perryville Inn, with a portrait of Andrew Jackson on one side and an American flag on the other, is believed by tradition to have been painted by Bonnell, but he is not known to have painted other signs.  In 1825 Bonnell painted at least seven likenesses of Hunterdon County residents.  These vary widely in style.At least once Bonnell traveled across the New Jersey border into Pennsylvania, perhaps in search of portrait commissions.  In 1833 he painted a pair of portraits of Andrew and Eliza Everhart Yerkes, who owned a farm in Warminster, Bucks County, Pennsylvania.  1833 is the last known date of Bonnell's activity as a painter.

    "biography": "André Giroux was born in Paris in 1801. He had begun his studies with his father, a minor history painter, and made his debut at the Salon of 1819 when only eighteen years old. His earliest exhibits were urban genre scenes, but starting in 1822 he also submitted landscape studies from nature. In 1825 his competition entry on the subject of the Hunt of Meleager was awarded the Rome Prize for Historical Landscape, despite the fact that, unaffiliated with any of the leading academic teachers, Giroux had no influential backers. His fellow students at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, members of the rising romantic generation that scorned classical landscape, used the award ceremony to stage a noisy protest. The scene was witnessed by Amaury-Duval, a pupil of Ingres, who recalled in his memoirs that the Rome Prize laureate fled sobbing into his father's arms, pursued by the jeers of the audience. During his long stay in Italy (1825-1830), Giroux became associated with a group of young landscape painters that included Edouard Bertin (1797-1871), Th6odore-Caruelle d'Aligny (1798-1871), and Léon Fleury (1804-1858), and made the acquaintance of Camille Corot (1796-1875), to whose landscape studies painted in the environs of Rome Giroux' own open-air sketches bear some resemblance. Like Corot, he sent a composed Italian landscape to the Salon of 1827 but at the same time submitted his more spontaneous studies tainted from nature in the Roman Campagna. His View of Casa Prota in the Sabine Hills won a gold medal at the Salon of 1831. Thereafter he continued as a regular exhibitor at the Salon until 1874, concentrating during the 1830s and 1840s on Italian subjects composed in the studio with the help of naturalistically observed detail studies gathered out-of-doors. In his later years, Giroux reverted to French landscapes and, having made the transition from Arcadian classicism to naturalism in Italian settings, ventured further toward modernity with paintings of industrial sites.

    "biography": "Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, born in Paris in 1796, was the son of a prosperous draper and of a mother well known as a fashionable modiste in the years of the Empire and the Restoration. The infant was put in the care of a nurse in a village near L'Isle-Adam on the Oise river, where he grew into a sturdy and cheerful country boy. After grammar school in Paris, he attended a lycée in Rouen (1807-1812) under the guardianship of M. Sennegon, a quiet man and lover of nature, who often took him on meditative evening walks. Two further years in a boarding school near Paris concluded his formal studies, which, though far from brilliant, left him with a predilection for classical literature and its values of harmony and style.His tastes inclined him to art, but his father wanted him to become a merchant. Apprenticed to a draper, Corot demonstrated his incompetence for business. Placed in another firm, under an indulgent manager, he proved employable as a delivery boy, though much given to admiring the sky and loitering at shop windows. To satisfy his appetite for work with pencil and brush, he enrolled in evening sessions at the private Académie Suisse, where, for a fee, he could draw the posing model.When in 1822, aged twenty-six, he was still without a profession, his parents despaired of his fitness for moneymaking and settled an annuity on him that allowed him to go his own way. He found a studio near his parents' shop and took instruction from a painter of his own age, Achille-Etna Michallon (1796-1822), laureate of the Rome Prize for Historical Landscape in 1817, who had recently returned from Rome. Corot sketched with Michallon in the environs of Paris, but their work together ended when Michallon died in September 1822. He next turned to Jean-Victor Bertin (1767-1842), a more rigorous classicist, who in the course of three years thoroughly initiated him to his methods, but from whom Corot had the wit to absorb only what suited his own vision. He set up his easel on the quays of Paris, sketched from nature in Normandy, in the forest of Fontainebleau, and at Ville-d'Avray, where his parents owned a country house. His early development was rapid and sure. The studies from 1822-1825 already contain, in their modest directness and lucidity, the essence of his personal style.To further his education, he started in the fall of 1825 on the obligatory voyage to Italy. Arriving in the rainy Roman winter, he began with studies of street people whom he posed casually in his room at the Spanish Steps. In his small, candidly direct pictures of Italian folk he avoided the picturesque or sentimental conventions then in vogue among his French colleagues, who in their turn regarded him with friendly condescension. Rome's art treasures did not greatly interest him. He spent little time in the churches and galleries but was drawn to the Roman townscape with its tawny brickwork under azure skies. In the spring of 1826 he worked daily in the Farnese Gardens painting the prospect of Roman ruins spread before him in the slanting light of morning or afternoon. With an instinctive sense of arrangement, conditioned by the lessons of his former teachers, he gave his studies a seemingly natural harmony and balance, responding as much to the light and atmosphere of these views as to their material features. In the fairweather months of 1826 and 1827, he searched the environs of Rome for motifs, and found one, the bridge at Narni, on which he based the picture with which he made his debut at the Paris Salon of 1827 (National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa). After further excursions and a visit to Naples, he left Rome in September 1828 and returned to Paris by way of Venice. Back in France, he settled into an annual routine of travel and open-air sketching in spring and summer, followed by winter work in the studio to elaborate his sketches into exhibitable compositions. The outbreak of revolution in July 1830 briefly disturbed his rounds, sending him for shelter to Chartres, where he accomplished one of the most serene of his architectural landscapes, Chartres Cathedral (Louvre).Corot understood that to be noticed on the crowded walls of the Salon he must work on an impressive scale and introduce interesting subject matter into his foregrounds. Using studies gathered in Italy and in the forest of Fontainebleau, he composed landscapes of increasingly large size for exhibition, enlivening their foregrounds with rustic genre motifs. His first success came at the Salon of 1833, where his Vue de la forêt de Fontainebleau (location unknown), reminiscent of John Constable's (1776-1837) Hay Wain (exhibited in Paris in 1824, National Gallery, London), won a silver medal. His simple landscapes nevertheless attracted little notice and no purchasers. To give his work something of the prestige of \"historical\" landscape, Corot in 1834 introduced a biblical motif, a meditating Magdalene, into the composed landscape of unusually large size that he sent to the Salon of that year, the National Gallery of Art's Forest of Fontainebleau (1963.10.109).In May 1834 he set out on a six-month tour of northern Italy, traveling along the Mediterranean coast to Genoa, Pisa, and Volterra, and continuing to Florence and Venice.  His studies from this second Italian voyage, fewer in number, are larger and more richly furnished than those of his first stay. Back in France, he resumed his effort to go beyond pure landscape in his Salon exhibits by giving them a narrative content.  His yearly submissions to the Salons, starting with Hagar in the Wilderness (1835, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and continuing through the end of the 1830s with Diana and Actaeon (1836, also Metropolitan Museum of Art), Saint Jerome in the Desert (1837, church, Ville-d'Avray), Silenus (1838, The Minneapolis Institute of Arts), and Flight into Egypt (1840, church, Rosny-sur-Seine), gradually gave him visibility as a painter of \"historical\" landscape. Classicist training and an innate disposition enabled him to integrate various studies in one well-ordered design, without strain or recourse to formulas. His View near Volterra of 1838 at the National Gallery of Art (1963.10.111), blending earlier landscape studies with discreet borrowings from the masters, preserves the freshness of observed reality.Until his mid-forties, Corot, still dependent on his parents who fondly regarded him as a talentless amateur, lived on his small allowance, cheerfully productive despite the public's indifference. But among artists he was beginning to find admirers. The first signal of official recognition was given him at the Salon of 1840 when the government bought his Le Petit Berger (La Cour d'Or, Musées de Metz), an early example of what came to be known as his \"lyrical\" style. In May 1843 he departed on his third and last Italian voyage, traveling directly to Rome for a six-months' stay, during which he took excursions to Tivoli, Genzano, and Lake Nemi. In a number of the relatively few paintings from this journey--The Gardens of the Villa d'Este (Tivoli) (Louvre), a study of early twilight, and The Goatherd of Genzano (The Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C.), an impression of hot sunlight--his naturalism attained its ultimate refinement.On his return to Paris in 1844 he resubmitted his Destruction of Sodom (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) to the Salon from which it had been rejected the year before and had the satisfaction of seeing it hung.  The following year, he showed Homer and the Shepherds (1845, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Saint-Lô) in which the landscape setting, though based on a drawing from nature, is more artificial and poetically vague than the backgrounds of his earlier historical compositions.  His Forest of Fontainebleau (exhibited as Vue des gorges d'Apremont at the Salon of 1846, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), by contrast, indicates the persistence of a robustly naturalist strain in his work, reflecting his encounters with Théodore Rousseau and Jules Dupré at about this time. In 1846 the government awarded Corot the cross of the Legion of Honor. Major state commissions now came to him, among them a large Baptism of Christ (1847, Saint-Nicolas de Chardonnet, Paris).  When his father died in 1847, Corot interrupted his study travel to devote himself to his mother with whom he went to live at Ville-d'Avray. The Revolution of 1848 passed him by, as had that of 1830. At the jury-free Salon of that year he showed no fewer than nine paintings and received a second-class medal. In 1851 his mother died. Corot, now orphaned at fifty-five, warded off loneliness by staying with hospitable friends in various parts of France. Between these adoptive homes he traveled in yearly rounds, combining landscape study with the pleasures of cordial domesticity.Corot's work from this time on fell into three main categories: private studies from nature of landscape or of the human figure; historical compositions destined for the Salon; and work for sale--composed landscapes in hazily atmospheric settings for which there developed a strong demand. Studies from nature Corot usually secreted in his studio, to be seen only by friends. His Port of La Rochelle (1851, Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven) is exceptional in being a finished study that he chose to show at a Salon (1852). For public exhibition he preferred narrative figural compositions on religious or literary subjects, such as his Saint Sebastian Aided by the Holy Women (1853, The Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore), in which he placed figures of remarkable expressive vigor in shadowy dream landscapes that were only remotely derived from his nature studies, but perhaps owed something to his enjoyment of the theater and its scenery.  For sale, he produced what came to be expected of him: harmonious arrangements of diaphanous trees, crepuscular skies, and distant sheets of water, nostalgic memories of favorite sites in Italy or France. The steady, rising demand for these landscape-poems by collectors and dealers tempted him into repetition. Soon, his own large output was augmented by a flood of vulgarizing imitations and forgeries.The Universal Exposition of 1855, at which six of his paintings were shown, confirmed his popular success and won him a gold medal. Napoleon III put the official seal on the fashion for Corot's lyrical landscapes by purchasing his Souvenir de Marcoussis (1853, Musée d'Orsay, Paris) for his personal collection.  Corot sometimes combined his \"lyrical\" manner with subjects taken from reality, composing foregrounds of feathery trees through which, as through a screen, he opened views into distances occupied by buildings as concrete and clearly defined as those in his early townscapes. The visual precision evident in such later paintings as Mantes Cathedral (c. 1865, Musée Saint-Denis, Reims), The Bridge of Mantes (c. 1868, Louvre), and the National Gallery of Art's Ville-d'Avray (1955.9.1) proves that, despite his concessions to decorative or poetic effect, Corot had lost nothing of his keenness of observation.Portraits and figure studies, painted on the side throughout his life, took on a new importance in his private work of the 1850s and 1860s.  While in his imagined landscapes he cultivated a hazy indefiniteness, he went in the opposite direction in his paintings of the figure. Posing models in costume or in the nude, he stressed their physical presence, defining their bodies with sculptural vigor and their costumes with strong color. In 1866-1870 he suffered attacks of gout that forced him to curtail travel and outdoor work. Confined to his Paris studio, he painted landscapes from memory and posed models in portraitlike arrangements, sometimes on a monumental scale, as in the National Gallery of Art's Agostina (1963.10.108). In a series of interiors from 1865-1872, among them the Gallery's Studio of the Artist (1942.9.11), he represented young women in Italian costume seated in his studio, in solitary meditation before an easel that holds one of his \"lyrical\" landscapes.About 1870 he recovered his health and worked with undiminished energy, sustained by a robust constitution. Throughout the Franco-Prussian War and the siege of Paris (1870-1871), he remained at work in his Paris studio. The civil war of the Commune in 1871 drove him to the provincial quiet of Douai, where he painted a masterly townscape, The Belfry, Douai (1871, Louvre), as subtle in color and firm in handling as any of his architectural views of the 1830s. When peace returned, he resumed his migratory life, spending the year of 1872 in constant travel and outdoor painting. In his final years, his early, naturalist tendencies reasserted themselves in subjects taken from reality, such as his Interior of Sens Cathedral (1874, Louvre), which show that he preserved his clarity of vision and noble refinement of color to the end. He died on 22 February 1875 after a brief illness.For half a century, Corot's fame rested entirely on his late, composed landscapes. His studies from nature remained largely unknown. A drastic reevaluation occurred after 1900, when critics, surfeited with the \"poetic\" manner, discovered his early sketches and judged their freshness preferable to the repetitiousness of the later compositions. Meanwhile, this estimate is itself being revised; the qualities of Corot's best composed landscapes, no longer obscured by overfamiliarity, are being valued once again.[This is the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "The painting Melons and Grapes (1957.11.5) came to the National Gallery with only the name \"Chipman\".  According to the caption in Panorama 1 (April 1946), 76, an inscription on the back of the painting indicated that Chipman painted the scene from memory in winter time.  No inscription was recorded by Alberto Angeli, who lined the picture in 1950, nor is any mention made in the other donor records.  It seems likely that the Panorama caption refers not to an inscription on the painting but rather to the inscription on the back of a small photograph of a man which apparently accompanied the painting when the donors purchased it.  The photograph, though captioned \"Nehemiah Cobb\" in pencil on the front, is inscribed in ink on the reverse: \"Mr Chipman the one that painted the picture of the fruit watermellon [sic] and others in winter with nothing to look at for guide.\"  Above this is penciled \"Jan. 1832,\" and below it \"OPS [Old Print Shop, owned by Harry Shaw Newman] 846.\"  The Old Print Shop envelope containing the photograph is labeled \"Photograph of the Artist Chipman.\"  It has not been possible to determine if this photograph actually depicts Chipman or whether the date 1832 has any relationship to the painting.  Furthermore, it is not known when the photograph first became associated with the painting, or whether the name Chipman was assigned to the painting because of the photograph or for some other reason.Efforts to locate such an artist have been unsuccessful, especially given the absence of a first name or initial; censuses indicate that the name was common in various states around the mid-nineteenth century.  No other works by this hand have been identified.  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "Albert Pinkham Ryder was born in 1847 in New Bedford, Massachusetts, where he attended a public grammar school for boys and began to paint, but impaired vision, the result of a faulty vaccination, prevented him from continuing his education.  After the Ryder family moved to New York in 1870, his application to the National Academy of Design was rejected, and he was admitted only after a period of study with the portraitist and engraver William E. Marshall (1837-1906), a former pupil of Thomas Couture.  Although Ryder first exhibited at the Academy in 1873, and continued to exhibit there between 1881 and 1888, it was not until 1902 that he was elected an associate member, and he was made a full member in 1906.Ryder quickly allied himself with some of the most progressive figures in American art.  In 1875 he participated, along with John La Farge and William Morris Hunt, in an exhibition of works by artists who had been rejected by the conservative National Academy. The event was sponsored by the New York branch of the English firm of interior decorators Cottier & Company, and its owner Daniel Cottier became Ryder's dealer and played an important role in promoting the artist's career.  In 1877 Ryder visited The Netherlands and spent a month in London with Cottier.  That same year, along with Louis Comfort Tiffany, La Farge, George Inness, Olin Levi Warner, and J. Alden Weir, he became one of the founding members of the Society of American Artists, and exhibited with the group regularly until 1887.  During the late 1870s Ryder painted screens, mirror frames, and furniture panels that link him to the Decorative Movement.In 1880 Ryder took a studio in the Benedick Building on Washington Square East, where he lived and worked for the next decade.  Perhaps influenced by his new friendship with the Symbolist painter Robert Loftin Newman, Ryder abandoned the Barbizon style pastoral landscapes upon which he had established his reputation in the 1870s, and began to paint dramatic and emotionally charged subjects based on classical mythology, biblical incidents, poetry, plays, and Wagnerian opera.  He occasionally wrote poetry to accompany his paintings.  This transformation was also brought about by his visits to the major art museums of Europe and an excursion to North Africa with Cottier and Warner during the summer of 1882.  By the middle 1880s Ryder had the support of influential critics, and attracted a number of important patrons.  He made brief visits to London in 1887 and 1896.  Around 1900 the increasingly reclusive and eccentric Ryder ceased producing new compositions and began to rework and repair existing paintings.  He was awarded a silver medal at the Pan American Exposition at Buffalo in 1901, and was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1908.  His work appealed to the new generation of American modernists, and ten of his pictures were included in the 1913 New York Armory Show. After his health began to fail in 1915, Ryder moved to Elmhurst, Long Island, where he died in 1917.One of the most enigmatic figures in the history of American art, Ryder was an imaginative and innovative painter who worked in the late nineteenth century visionary tradition.  Long considered an isolated and uniquely American phenomenon, his personal idiosyncracies overemphasized, it has only recently been recognized that Ryder was keenly aware of European art and techniques.  His chronological development is impossible to trace because he never dated his works, rarely signed them, and obsessively reworked his compositions after they had been exhibited or sold.  His unorthodox technical procedures, by which he strove to achieve rich, dark colors and enamel-like surfaces through multiple layers of glazes and pigments, left his works unusually susceptible to changes and deterioration, so it is difficult to determine their original appearance.  Although he produced only 160 pictures, his works were widely forged, and some authentic ones were altered by others after his death.  Ryder never had any pupils, but he exerted a powerful influence on his contemporary Ralph Blakelock, and a generation of younger artists such as Arthur B. Davies, Marsden Hartley, Rockwell Kent, Walt Kuhn, and Kenneth Hayes Miller.  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]1",

    "biography": "Théodore Rousseau was born in 1812 in Paris, the son of a tailor from the Jura region. Sent at thirteen to his father's native province, to do office work at a sawmill, he learned to know and love the forests of the Jura. On his return to Paris, having decided to become a landscape painter, he studied briefly with Charles Rémond (1795-1875), a painter of historical landscape, whose instruction he found unhelpful and whom he left, in 1828, for another, no less academic, master, the history painter Guillon-Lethière (1760-1832). He had meanwhile begun to sketch on his own at Saint-Cloud and in the forests of Compiègne and Fontainebleau. In 1829 he vainly tried to enter the academic competition for the Rome Prize for Historical Landscape. The following year, on a tour in the Auvergne, he painted his earliest, distinctly personal landscape studies, on which in 1831 he based his first Salon entry. From a voyage to Normandy in 1832, he returned with studies of sky and sea that he used for The Coast near Granville exhibited in 1833. The following year, a landscape of \"Dutch\" character, Edge of the Forest at Pierrefonds, was bought by the duc d'Orléans and won him a medal at the Salon. He had meanwhile joined a bohemian clique gathered around Théophile Thoré, an early socialist and future art critic, which included the \"prophet\" Ganneau, known as the Mapa, who preached ecstatic nature worship. Rousseau's association with these eccentrics and dissenters irritated the Salon authorities, who retaliated by rejecting his submissions. On a tour in the Jura in 1835 he conceived a vast, crowded composition, Descent of the Cattle from the Meadows, that occupied him for a year; it was emphatically rejected by the Salon of 1836. More rebuffs in the following years discouraged him from entering further work. Finding the Salon closed to him, he shifted to saleable subjects of modest scale, treated in a naturalist style. In search of motifs, he visited the forest of Fontainebleau, staying at Chailly in 1834 and, at Barbizon in 1836. In The Forest at Bas-Bréau (Louvre), begun in 1836 and completed in 1867 after many revisions, he presented nature in its irregular forms of growth and decay, without regard to conventions of formal arrangement, while in The Avenue of Chestnuts (Louvre), painted during 1837-1840, he composed a symmetrical view, animated by the writhings of interwoven branches that form a natural architecture. With Jules Dupré (1811-1889), his friend and painting companion in the 1840s, he explored the spacious plains of the Berry and Landes regions, which led him to develop a new compositional scheme, opening large skies and wide horizons behind trees formed of massed dots of color that suggest wind-stirred foliage. During 1845 and 1846 he shared a studio with Dupré in L'Isle-Adam. A contented bachelor until then, he was brought to the brink of matrimony in 1847 by the novelist George Sand who offered him the hand of her adopted daughter. Gossip, which Rousseau blamed on Dupré, frustrated the match. Deeply resentful, he withdrew to the village of Barbizon at the edge of the forest of Fontainebleau, accompanied by an ailing woman, Eliza Gros, with whom he shared the rest of his life. For purposes of business he kept a Paris address.The Revolution of 1848, in which he took no active part, temporarily broke the power of academic juries. A committee of artists, including Rousseau, took charge of the liberated Salon, to which he did not himself contribute that year.  The government of the new Republic, to make amends for past neglect, asked him for a picture on a subject of his own choice. The result was the large and rather formal View of the Forest of Fontainebleau: Sunset (Louvre). In 1849, at his first Salon in fourteen years, he showed three paintings and was given a gold medal; but Dupré, who had exhibited nothing, received the cross of the Legion of Honor. This ended their friendship. Jean-François Millet, who had moved to Barbizon in 1849, now took Dupré's place in Rousseau's life. Appointed to the Salon jury in 1850, Rousseau exhibited seven paintings that year. The Legion of Honor at last accepted him following the Salon of 1852, at which the duc de Morny, half brother of Napoleon III had bought his Oaks at Apremont (Louvre). Thi following years were an interlude of prosperity in his life. At the Universal Exposition of 1855, which he had helped to jury, his entry of thirteen paintings won a triumphant success. But a reaction soon set in.  At the Salons of 1857-1863 his paintings were coldly received. The demand for his work slackened; sales held in 1861 and 1863 produced poor results. Rousseau lived in a state of nervous excitation, haunted by creditors and depressed by his wife's gradual decline into insanity. Mannerisms of color and pattern, at odds with the naturalism expected of him, reawakened the hostility of the critics. In 1866 large purchases by the dealers Brame and Durand-Ruel temporarily restored his finances. Later that year, he was elected president of the art jury for the Universal Exposition of 1867, and at its close received the Grand Medal of Honor. But, unlike other members of the jury, he was not made an officer of the Legion of Honor. The emperor himself ultimately repaired this slight, but the exasperation it had caused Rousseau broke his health. Cared for by Millet, he died in his cottage at Barbizon in December 1867.Rousseau's naturalism was the product of meditative study, not rapid transcription: incapable of spontaneity, he doggedly reworked his pictures in the studio. He understood nature as a process of constant growth and dissolution and thought of trees as fellow creatures, each marked by its own fate and struggle. Solitary, pious without religion, a materialist romantically in love with nature, he sought in his work to reconcile emotional empathy with objective sight.

    "biography": "John Neagle was born November 4, 1796, while his parents--Irish-born Maurice Nagle and Susannah Taylor, the daughter of a New Jersey farmer--were visiting Boston from their home in Philadelphia.  He was baptized as a Roman Catholic, attended grammar school in Philadelphia, and briefly studied art with the drawing master and artist Pietro Ancora.  He worked in his step-father Lawrence Ennis's grocery and liquor store until the age of fifteen, when he was apprenticed to a local coach decorator named Thomas Wilson. When Wilson began to take painting lessons from Bass Otis, Neagle was impressed with the likenesses he saw in that artist's studio, and resolved to become a portraitist himself.  He studied with Otis for about two months and embarked on a rigorous independent study of art.  By 1815 he had begun to paint small oil sketches that he sold for five dollars apiece.  It was around this time that the aspiring artist resolved to change the spelling of his name from Nagle to Neagle, after seeing an illustration in Joel Barlow's Columbiad (Philadelphia, 1807) that had been engraved by James Neagle (c. 1769-1822).  Neagle was further inspired when Otis introduced him to Thomas Sully, who soon became his mentor.Tired from the drudgery of decorating coaches and encouraged by the successful results of his early efforts, Neagle left Wilson and set up a modest practice.  In 1818 he sought greater professional opportunities in Lexington, Kentucky, but was frustrated by the presence there of Matthew Harris Jouett.  He proceeded to New Orleans, where prospects for a portraitist were equally bleak, and immediately returned to Philadelphia, where he remained for the rest of his life.Neagle began to exhibit at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1821, and his earliest portraits of Indians, actors, and clergymen contain the distinguishing characteristic of his mature style: they are forceful, penetrating likenesses that capture the essence of his sitters' personalities.  He excelled in portraits of men, but his images of women were often of remarkably inferior quality.  Perhaps as a reaction to detail-oriented coach decoration, Neagle was predisposed to learn the painterly British style of Joshua Reynolds, Henry Raeburn, and Thomas Lawrence that he absorbed through Sully's tutelage.  In the summer of 1825 he returned to the city of his birth, where he studied with Gilbert Stuart and met Washington Allston. Stuart's influence on Neagle's development was decisive, and reinforced his penchant for the loose, abbreviated British style.On 29 May 1826 he married Sully's step-daughter Mary Chester Sully, and departed immediately for New York City.  There he executed portraits of noted actors and actresses that later appeared as engraved illustrations in a series of books titled The Acting American Theatre.  Thereafter followed a period of intense artistic activity during which his artistic style matured rapidly.  In 1827 Neagle painted the portrait that earned him a national reputation and for which he is best remembered today, the full-length Pat Lyon at the Forge (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston). He painted a second version of it in 1829 (Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia).  The culminating accomplishment of this period, the Grand Manner portrait Dr. William Potts Dewees (1833, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia), demonstrates how well Neagle mastered the British style without ever having studied in England.Throughout his long career Neagle painted Philadelphia's prominent doctors, lawyers, businessmen, and clergymen of various denominations.  His portraits are often remarkable for the iconographic devices he used to explicate his subjects' professions or important experiences in their lives.  Self-educated and conversant on a wide variety of intellectual pursuits, he moved freely in the city's elite social circles.  An active and sometimes outspoken exponent of artists' rights who spared no efforts to promote the fine arts in America, Neagle was elected first president of the Artists' Fund Society, a group of dissident artists who had seceded from the Pennsylvania Academy in 1835.In the early autumn of 1842 a group of Philadelphia's prominent Whig citizens commissioned him to paint the full-length Henry Clay (The Union League of Philadelphia), a portrait that served as a political icon for the Germantown Clay Club during the statesman's bid for the presidency of the United States in 1844.  The artist travelled to Clay's farm Ashland in Lexington, Kentucky, and remained in the state painting prominent people until early 1843.  The Clay portrait was Neagle's last major work.  Depressed by the death of his beloved wife in 1845, he gradually withdrew from society.  With very few exceptions, his artistic creativity diminished and his activity as a professional portraitist gradually tapered off.  Neagle continued to paint portraits until the late 1850s, when he suffered a severe stroke.  He died in Philadelphia in 1865.

    "biography": "Chester Harding was born in 1792 in Conway, Massachusetts, the fourth of 12 children whose father, an unsuccessful inventor, experienced some difficulty in providing for his numerous offspring.  Harding thus spent several years in the household of an aunt, and at age 12 he was hired out to help with the support of his family.  When he was 14, his parents decided to move to the relatively unsettled area of Monroe County, New York.  There he dabbled in a variety of trades--including drum-making, cabinetry, and tavern-keeping--without much success.Shortly after his marriage to Caroline Woodruff in 1815, he was forced to leave New York State because of mounting debts.  His young family then joined him in Pittsburgh, where he began painting houses.  Around 1818 he was introduced to portraiture by an itinerant artist named Nelson.  Largely self-taught, he achieved some success before moving to Kentucky, where a brother was already engaged in the portrait trade.  There he felt the influence of Matthew Jouett, a slightly older artist working in the manner of Gilbert Stuart.  Over the next few years Harding painted in Kentucky, Ohio, Missouri, and Washington, D.C., traveling to Philadelphia for two months of study at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts during the winter of 1819-1820.  Business was good, and he received particular notoriety for a likeness of the 90-year-old Daniel Boone, which was engraved by several printmakers.In 1823 Harding spent six months in Boston, where he received an astounding reception and more commissions than he could carry out. He later admitted that his success was due largely to his reputation as an untaught \"primitive\" from the frontier, a mythic status upon which he would capitalize for several years to come. Despite his good fortune, he moved his family that year to Northampton, Massachusetts, in preparation for his anticipated trip to Europe.Harding soon left for London, where he met artists Charles Robert Leslie and Sir Thomas Lawrence and temporarily adapted his tight, finished style to the looser brushwork then in fashion in Britain. He met with extremely good fortune in England, Scotland, and Ireland.  Taken by his plain mannerisms and humble origins, aristocrats with a democratic bent--and even members of the royal family--commissioned their likenesses from him.  Pleased with his popularity, Harding made the decision to settle in Glasgow and sent for his family to join him there.  Soon after they arrived, however, he was forced to abandon his plans and return to Boston in 1826 after a British financial panic destroyed his business.For the rest of his life, Harding's career was centered in Boston, although he made his home in Springfield, Massachusetts, beginning in 1830.  He became an important and visible force in the Boston art world, largely through his ownership of a studio building that was the site of many important exhibitions.  Much of each year was also spent on the road, executing portraits in New York, Louisiana, Kentucky, and points in between.  In all, he is thought to have painted over 1000 portraits.  After the death of his wife in 1845, he made a second, nine-month visit to Europe.  Thereafter he painted less, though never giving up his brushes entirely.  His interests late in life gravitated toward landscape architecture and fishing.  He died in Boston in 1866.

    "biography": "Thomas Cole, America's leading landscape painter during the first half of the nineteenth century, was born on February 1, 1801 in Bolton-le-Moor, England.  Before emigrating with his family to the United States in 1818, he served as an engraver's assistant and as an apprentice to a designer of calico prints.  Cole worked briefly as an engraver in Philadelphia before joining his family in Steubenville, Ohio, in 1819.  While in Ohio he apparently learned the rudiments of oil painting from an itinerant portrait painter named Stein.  In 1823, during a stay in Pittsburgh, Cole began drawing from nature, creating closely observed and intensely expressive images of trees and branches.  Later that year he returned to Philadelphia, where he studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and worked in a variety of art-related jobs.In April 1825 Cole moved to New York, where his family had also relocated.  That summer he made an extensive sketching tour up the Hudson River and into the Catskill Mountains.  In late October 1825 three of his landscapes were sold to three prominent figures in the young nation's art community, John Trumbull (1756-1843), William Dunlap (1766-1839), and Asher B. Durand (1796-1886).  In January 1826 Cole was elected a founding member of the National Academy of Design, and his works were increasingly in demand with leading patrons such as Daniel Wadsworth (1771-1848) of Hartford and Robert Gilmor, Jr. (1774-1848) of Baltimore.Although Cole had ample commissions in the late 1820s to paint pictures of American scenery, his ambition was to create a \"higher style of landscape\" that could express moral or religious meanings. His first major efforts in this vein met with mixed reviews, and he decided study and travel in Europe were necessary.  In June 1829 Cole sailed for England, where he studied the works of Old Masters and also met Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775-1851) and John Constable (1776-1837).  He subsequently traveled in France and in Italy, with lengthy stays in Rome and Florence.  While in Italy he conceived of a multi-part landscape series tracing the rise and fall of an archetypal civilization.  Although he failed to interest Gilmor in commissioning the series, upon his return to America in 1832 Cole did manage to convince the retired New York merchant Luman Reed (1785-1836) to support his grand project.  The result, the five canvas Course of Empire (New-York Historical Society), was completed in 1836 and received considerable popular attention and generally favorable reviews.Cole continued to paint American landscapes in the 1830s and early 1840s, but much of his energy in these years went into the creation of complex imaginary works such as Departure and Return (1837, Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.) and the two versions of The Voyage of Life (1839-1840, Munson-Williams-Proctor Institute, Utica, and 1842, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.).  In 1836 he married Maria Barstow and settled in Catskill, New York, a small village on the west side of the Hudson and close to the Catskill Mountains.  That same year Cole, who was throughout his career a prolific writer of prose and poetry, published his \"Essay on American Scenery\" in the American Monthly Magazine, in which he expressed many of his most deeply felt convictions about landscape painting.In 1841 Cole make a second trip abroad, with extensive travel in Italy, including a memorable visit to Sicily that resulted in several views of Mt.  Etna.  He returned to Catskill in 1842; in 1844 he accepted the young Frederic Edwin Church as a pupil on Daniel Wadsworth's recommendation.  In the mid and late 1840s Cole painted many impressive American landscapes, which are notable for an increased accuracy in the depiction of atmosphere and light.  At the same time he labored, ultimately without success, to complete a five-part series called The Cross and the World, in which he endeavored to portray the individual's quest for spiritual knowledge and salvation.Cole's premature death in Catskill on February 11, 1848, was universally mourned and a comprehensive memorial exhibition of his works was quickly organized in New York.  His influence on the course of American landscape painting was profound and his works influenced numerous younger painters who matured in the late 1840s and early 1850s, most notably Jasper F. Cropsey and Church.  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "Erastus Salisbury Field and his twin sister, Salome, were born in Leverett, Massachusetts, on 19 May 1805.  Erastus Field showed an early talent for sketching portraits, and in 1824 the aspiring artist traveled to New York City to study with Samuel F.  B. Morse.  Field's instruction was cut short by the death of Morse's wife in 1825, and it is not evident what Field learned.  He and another pupil were described by Morse as \"very tractable and useful.\"  The next documentation of Field's activity is an 1828 letter in which the artist reported that people considered his portraits \"good likenesses.\"  In 1831 he married Phebe Gilmur in Ware, Massachusetts, and their only child was born the next year.  His career apparently prospered during the 1830s, for the artist produced a multitude of rapidly executed portraits (often completed in one day) which commanded fair prices.  Field's best portraits date from around 1836--the year he returned to Leverett from Ware--to about 1840.After traveling to Brattleboro, Vermont, in 1839, the artist and his wife moved back to Ware, Massachusetts.  By 1841, however, they were in New York City.  Field remained there for about seven years and exhibited several works.  In 1848 he was called home to manage his father's farm in Sunderland, Massachusetts, and a newspaper account reported that he remained there for \"some four years in the practice of his art.\"By around 1847 Field had begun executing landscape and history paintings, perhaps because the daguerreotype, introduced in America in 1839, was beginning to replace painted portraits.  Always resourceful, however, Field took advantage of the camera, using it to make photographs of his sitters which he would later copy on canvas.Between 1852 and his wife's death in 1859, Field, usually with his family, moved frequently between Sunderland, Palmer, and North Amherst, Massachusetts.  When Phebe Field died, the artist and his daughter moved to Plumtrees, a settlement now in Sunderland that was occupied by the Cooley and Hubbard families, whom Field had known since childhood.  Field, who would spend the rest of his life there, built a modest studio and painted some elaborate compositions of exotic landscapes and biblical scenes, relying on his imagination as well as on printed illustrations by artists such as John Martin.Field died at Plumtrees in 1900, leaving a legacy of over three hundred paintings attributed to his hand.  Just before his death a newspaper article praised his portraits, saying that they were \"as nearly correct as can well be made in oil, and give to posterity faithful ideas of the personal appearance of their ancestors.\"  Field's career exemplified that of the enterprising itinerant who created distinctive, quickly executed yet insightful likenesses to meet the growing demands of America's middle-class patrons.

    "biography": "The son of parents who were both painters of miniature portraits, Antoine-Jean Gros was born in Paris in 1771. At the age of fifteen he became one of the first pupils of Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825) on the latter's return from Italy after his completion of the Oath of the Horatii. Though his excitable and sensitive personality and his relish for color and movement that attracted him to Rubens hardly fit the classicist mold, a close relationship developed between master and pupil. Distressed by scenes of violence that he had witnessed in the early days of the Revolution, Gros made an unsuccessful try for the Rome Prize in 1792. Fearing for his safety, David used his influence to secure him a study leave for Rome in 1793. When anti-French rioting made his stay there unsafe, he led a migratory life in northern Italy, painting portraits for a living. In 1797 he encountered Josephine Bonaparte in Genoa. Pleased with the handsome young artist, she took him to Milan to introduce him to her husband, then engaged in his victorious campaign against Austria. Gros became a member of the general's court and with Josephine's help persuaded Napoleon to sit for a portrait. The result, Napoleon at the Battle of Arcola (1797, versions at the Louvre and Versailles), satisfied Napoleon who appointed Gros Inspector of Parades and member of the commission stripping Italian churches and palaces of works of art. After his return to France, Gros continued to serve Bonaparte as official and private portraitist.  He won the competition for a picture commemorating the Battle of Nazareth fought by one of Napoleon's lieutenants in the Egyptian campaign. Caring little for the glorification of a subordinate, Napoleon stopped its execution and instead had Gros paint Napoleon Visiting the Plague Hospital at Jafa (1804, Louvre). Representing Napoleon, radiant and invulnerable, as bringer of salvation to the horror of the pesthouse, the large canvas won a resounding success at the Salon of 1804. The most imaginative of the cohort of artists celebrating the empire's days of glory, Gros was constantly employed in painting battles and military portraits during the decade from 1804 to 1814. His Battle of Aboukir (1806, Versailles) and Battle of Eylau (1808, Louvre) established him as the preeminent poet of the battlefield. At the close of the Salon of 1808, Napoleon himself decorated Gros with the cross of the Legion of Honor. To Gericault, Delacroix, and others of the rising romantic generation, Gros came to be the most admired model, the modern antidote to academic classicism.But after 1809 signs of lassitude appeared in his official work, beginning with his Capitulation of Madrid (1810) and Napoleon at the Battle of the Pyramids (1810) and sinking to the point of feebleness in Meeting of Napoleon and Francis ll of Austria (1812). A last project, The Burning of Moscow (1812), was abandoned at the stage of compositional study. Meanwhile a vast and uncongenial enterprise, the decoration of the dome of the Pantheon with figures from French dynastic history (1811-1815), took a toll on his energy. His painterly talent appeared undiminished only in his martial portraits of the time, notably in General Fournier-Sarlovèze (1812, Louvre).The governments of the Restoration wooed Gros with titles and honors. Made a baron and appointed portrait painter to the king, the former chronicler of the heroic butchery of Napoleon's wars made the most of the ungrateful subjects assigned to him by the pacific Bourbons: scenes of flight, Embarkation of the Duchess of Angoulême (1819), and of retreat, Louis XVIII Leaving the Tuileries on Napoleon's Return from Elba (1817), achieving in the latter \"un des plus beaux ouvrages modernes,\" in Delacroix' opinion.When departing for exile in Brussels in 1816, David had entrusted Gros with his studio and his pupils and exhorted him to assume the leadership of the neoclassical school, then already in decline. The role did not suit Gros' talent or temperament. His spiritless attempts at classical history painting brought him scathing criticism. In poor health, unhappily married, despairing of his ability, he drowned himself in a shallow branch of the Seine at Meudon, on 25 June 1835.

    "biography": "John James Audubon was born April 26, 1785, in Les Cayes, Santo Domingo (now Haiti), the illegitimate son of French sea captain Jean Audubon and a servant, Jeanne Rabine.  In 1789, a few years after the death of his mother, he was taken to France and raised by his father and stepmother.  During a happy childhood at Coueron, near Nantes, he studied geography, fencing, and mathematics, but was most enthusiastic about exploring the out-of-doors and collecting and drawing birds' nests, eggs, and other curiosities.  Audubon claimed to have studied with the French neo-classical painter Jacques-Louis David, but there is no documentation to support this.In 1803 he was sent to America to operate Mill Grove, a farm near Philadelphia that his father had purchased in 1789.  Through mismanagement and neglect Audubon lost the farm, thus beginning a long series of early commercial failures for the young man, who preferred to devote his time to shooting and sketching specimens rather than to overseeing his business interests.  At Mill Grove, Audubon met Lucy Bakewell, whom he married in 1808.  They moved to Louisville, Kentucky, then to Henderson, Kentucky, and in later years to New Orleans.  Because he was often absent on collecting excursions, his wife worked as a governess and schoolteacher to support the family.  In 1819 Audubon was briefly jailed for debt. About this time he began to earn a living making likenesses in chalk, which he continued to do until 1826.  He also worked as a taxidermist in Cincinnati in 1820.Although he had met Alexander Wilson (1766-1813) in 1810 and had seen Wilson's great work American Ornithology, it was not until ten years later that Audubon arrived at the idea of publishing his own illustrations of birds and began collecting and drawing specifically toward that end.  With his assistant Joseph Mason, a young artist specializing in plants and insects, he journeyed from Cincinnati to New Orleans and Natchez.  In 1822 Audubon took lessons in oil painting from an itinerant artist named John Stein (or Steen).  This is his only recorded training in this medium.  He had been working primarily in pastels, but about this time he began increasingly to use watercolors.  Audubon visited Philadelphia in 1824 and arranged to show his work at the Academy of Natural Sciences.  He won no sponsorship in that city, however, because of his rough manner and the threat his project posed to the work of the favored Alexander Wilson.In 1826 Audubon turned to England to gain support for his venture. He found a warm and encouraging reception in Liverpool, where he showed his drawings and paintings at the Royal Institution. Gradually he gathered a group of subscribers and found an accomplished London engraving firm, Robert Havell & Son, thus enabling him to begin his project of creating large (double elephant folio) illustrations of American birds.  Audubon traveled back and forth between the United States and England a number of times over the next several years to secure specimens and financing for his production.  He was assisted by his sons John Woodhouse, who accompanied him on collecting trips, and Victor Gifford (1809-1860), who supervised the marketing and printing of the plates in London.  The Birds of America was issued in 87 parts of 5 plates each and when completed in June 1838 contained 435 hand-colored engravings of 1,065 birds of 489 species.  Accustomed to seeing specimens shown simply, against a blank background, some naturalists objected to Audubon's use of dramatic poses and settings.  Indeed, Audubon was sometimes guilty of endowing the creatures he depicted with almost human attitudes.  Yet his attempt to position them as he thought they moved in the wild, using wire armatures to support the freshly-killed subjects, was truly revolutionary.  Today The Birds of America engravings and the brilliant watercolors upon which they are based are admired not only for their ornithological exactness, but also for their vitality and keen sense of design.Even while Audubon was producing his visual record of American birds, he was documenting their characteristics and his own experiences in the wilderness in his Ornithological Biography, published in five volumes between 1831 and 1839.  By this time he had become a celebrated figure in the United States, appearing in the press, lecturing to the public, and mingling with important people such as President Andrew Jackson.  He was encouraged to undertake two new publications.  The first was a version of The Birds of America comprised of reduced-size illustrations, lithographs rather than engravings, printed 1839 to 1843.  The second was The Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America (printed 1845-1848), two volumes of handcolored lithographs based on watercolors by John James Audubon and his son John Woodhouse Audubon and accompanied by text written by their friend, the amateur naturalist, the Reverend John Bachman.  Both of these efforts were very successful and allowed the artist to retire in comfort.Audubon's last nine years were spent at Minnie's Land, thirty-five acres of property that he purchased on what is now upper Manhattan, facing the Hudson River.  He died there on January 27, 1851.  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "The portraitist Samuel Lovett Waldo was born April 6, 1783, in Windham, Connecticut, one of eight children born to farmer Zacheus Waldo and his wife Esther Stevens Waldo.  At the age of sixteen he went to Hartford and took drawing lessons from an obscure painter named Joseph Steward.  He set up a studio there in 1803, but found few clients and supplemented his income by painting signs.  After a brief stay in Litchfield he proceeded to Charleston, South Carolina, and remained there for three years.  In 1806 he went to study art in England, where he introduced himself to Benjamin West and John Singleton Copley, and shared lodgings with Charles Bird King.  Waldo returned to America in 1809 and settled permanently in New York.  The artist's unusual character study Old Pat, the Independent Beggar (1819, The Boston Athenaeum) attracted considerable attention and was engraved by Asher B. Durand.  In 1820 he established a successful partnership sharing portrait commissions with a former pupil William Jewett.  The exact nature of their collaboration is unknown; some historians have speculated that Waldo painted the heads and hands, and Jewett was responsible for the costumes, accessories, and backgrounds, while others have dismissed the theory as untenable.Waldo served on the board of directors at the American Academy of the Fine Arts from 1817 until 1828, and in 1826 he was one of the founding members of the National Academy of Design, of which he became an associate in 1847.  He died in New York on February 16, 1861.  One of the most successful and competent portraitists active in New York during the first quarter of the nineteenth century, Waldo was a businesslike, conservative painter who produced sober, literal likenesses that seldom achieved profound insights into his clients' personalities.  There is some justification for critics who have dismissed him as a \"commercial face painter\" who was \"competent but never inspired.\"  Unlike many American artists who shared a similar origin, he transcended his humble beginnings and successfully assimilated the British painterly style to which he had been exposed at the Royal Academy. Waldo's esteem for this tradition is evidenced by the fact that he initiated a subscription at the National Academy to commission Thomas Lawrence to paint a full length portrait of Benjamin West, \"That artists might see what constituted a work of art in that branch of painting.\"  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "Ferneley was born in Thrussington, Leicestershire, on 18 May 1782.  He was first apprenticed to his father, a master wheelwright; then in 1801 Ferneley was apprenticed for three years to the sporting painter Ben Marshall.  He may also have studied at the Royal Academy Schools, though he is not listed in the students' register.  He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1806 and continued to exhibit there, at the British Institution, and at the Society of British Artists on Suffolk Street, but only sporadically.  From 1804 onward he traveled extensively executing commissions, making several long visits to Ireland between 1808 and 1812.  In 1814 Ferneley settled in Melton Mowbray, traveling less widely thereafter.Ferneley was a prolific painter who specialized in posed portraits of horses and of immaculately dressed sportsmen on their mounts (often in groups), large group portraits of an entire hunt, and hunting scenes, especially hunts in full cry.  He also painted coaches, carriages in Hyde Park, prize cattle, dogs, game, and sporting meetings.His clients included seven dukes and numerous members of the aristocracy; Lord Cardigan was one of his principal patrons.  In 1809 Ferneley married Sarah Kettle.  The couple had seven children, two of them later following their father's profession. Ferneley's wife died in 1836, and in 1844 he married Ann Allan, by whom he had another son.  He died at Melton Mowbray on 3 June 1860.

The name comes from the inscription on the National Gallery's Bowl of Fruit (1953.5.34), which reads PAINTED BY (at lower left) WILLIAM STEARNS (at lower right), and was probably applied with a stamp.  There are two other known pictures by Stearns, both still lifes.  He may be the man of that name from Mansield, Massachusetts, born in 1808, who is believed to have made calligraphic drawings in the 1820s and is recorded as having \"died a painter\" in 1845.  The Mansfield William Stearns was the son of Isaac and Susannah Stearns, and married Nancy Hicks Walker of Dighton, Massachusetts, in 1831.  In the possession of his descendants is an unsigned stencil picture of a horse, but they also have a great volume of calligraphic drawings and naive watercolors made by William's twin sisters, either of whom could have been its artist.  Although this William could well have been a theorem painter (using stencils to make pictures on fabric or paper), there is neither signed art work nor documentary evidence to indicate that he was.

The artist’s sojourn in Plaistow and in adjacent Haverill, Massachusetts, is documented in the diary of Isaac Watts Merrill (1803-1878). Jordan’s paintings are generally a bit crude, but quite vivid.

    "biography": "Asahel Lynde Powers, the son of Asahel, Jr. and Sophia Lynde Powers, was born in Springfield, Vermont, on 28 February 1813.  He began his career as an itinerant artist at an early age; the first portrait attributed to him is of Dr. Joel Green (?) from Rutland, Vermont, dated 1831.  Several portraits from the mid-1830s were painted in Springfield, indicating that Powers returned there periodically from his travels through Vermont, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.  Powers' paintings from the 1830s are considered his strongest portraits due to their intensity, crispness, and decorative quality.In the early 1840s the artist moved to Olney, Illinois.  A number of likenesses dated 1840 and painted in the area of Plattsburgh, New York, indicate that he began his journey west around this time and that he traveled through Clinton and Franklin Counties in New York, where relatives and other Vermont residents lived.  Powers' New York paintings from 1840, while not as strong as his New England portraits of the 1830s, are more accomplished, exhibiting penetrating characterization and better knowledge of modeling and perspective.  It is not known whether Powers' progression from a naive to a more academic style resulted from formal training or developed from his own experience and observation.  In Clinton, Powers' sitters were prominent, well-to-do citizens.  Perhaps for this clientele he strove to produce more academic portraits, which would in turn win him additional commissions.  While in New York Powers evidently gave painting instruction as well.  Landscape and still life painter Daniel Folger Bigelow (1823-1910) of Peru, New York, wrote that he acquired his first instruction from Powers, to whose influence he owed his own \"delicacy of coloring and treatment.\"There are no known works, however, from the artist's Illinois residency.  An 1844 document from Clinton County, the only evidence of Powers' marriage, orders Elizabeth M. Powers, his widow, to make an inventory of the deceased's possessions, suggesting that she may not have accompanied him to Illinois, where he died in 1843.

    "biography": "Milton W. Hopkins, the son of Hezekiah and Eunice Hubbell Hopkins, was born on 1 August 1789 in Harwinton, Connecticut.  In 1800 the family moved to Clinton, New York.  In 1807 he returned to Connecticut, soon marrying Abigail Pollard of Guilford, with whom he had a child.  After Abigail's death in 1817, he wed Almira Adkins and moved to Evans Mill, New York.  The births of nine children followed.  His occupation during the late teens and early twenties is unknown, but his acquisition of several acres of land suggests he may have farmed.By September 1824, when he advertised in the Newport (New York) Patriot, Hopkins was engaged in house and sign painting, gilding, glazing, chair-making, and selling painting supplies.  The previous year he and his family had moved to Newport, renamed Albion in 1826.  For a short time in 1828 he served as captain on an Albion canal boat, but by December of that year he was in Richmond, Virginia.  His advertisement in the Richmond Constitutional Whig on 16 December 1828 indicates that he was an instructor of women in Poonah, or theorem painting, and it is probable that he also assisted a Miss Turner, who ran an academy for drawing, penmanship, \"Music, Painting on Velvet, Wood and Paper, and Fancy Work.\"Hopkins returned to Albion in the fall of 1829, and in 1833 he advertised his services as both a teacher and a portrait painter.  Although Hopkins may have painted portraits before 1833, no earlier works have been discovered.  The first documented portrait, depicting an unidentified man, dates from that year.Later in 1836 Hopkins moved to Ohio--first to Cleveland, but shortly thereafter to a farm he purchased in Williamsburg, near Cincinnati.  He took up his brush again, painting a portrait of Margaret Place Baker of Cincinnati, which is not documented but closely resembles his slightly earlier inscribed portraits.  Within the next two years Hopkins was apparently exposed to academic portraiture.  The results can be seen in a pair of peculiar likenesses of Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin Connell, dated 1838, which show greater sophisticaton in the heads but have Hopkins' usual flatly painted bodies, in this case much too small for the head size.An advertisement of 23 April 1839 in The Ohio Statesman indicates that Hopkins had set up a studio in Columbus, but in the early 1840s he apparently painted portraits in Jackson, Mississippi, and elsewhere in the South.  His latest inscribed work, Mrs. R. Hinton and Her Daughters Josephine and Mary Ellen, dates from 1841.  Although the inscription provides the sitters' name, their place of residence has not been determined.  Hopkins returned to Cincinnati by 1843 and placed an advertisement in the Cincinnati business directory.  He died of pneumonia the following year.Hopkins came into contact with numerous potential clients for portraiture.  He was among those Masons who rejected the organization for its clandestine activities and became embroiled in the anti-Masonic controversies of the 1820s.  Throughout his life, Hopkins was actively involved in the affairs of the Presbyterian church, another potential source of patronage.  An outspoken man of strong convictions, he assisted in the Underground Railroad and participated in the temperance movement.  His persistent advertising and contact with successful and influential people of his time lead to the hope that more works will resurface.  There remains much confusion between the portraiture of Hopkins and that of the better known painter Noah North (1809-1880), who was active in the same geographic areas of New York State and Ohio during the same years.

That year, probably because of the death of his father, the artist returned to New London, where he subsequently advertised not only portraits and miniatures, but \"landscape, marine and fancy painting\" as well.  Although Sheffield offered a variety of pictures, most of his known works are three-quarter pose, half-length views of adults.  When he died in 1845 it was noted that he had been living in the center of New London's whaling district.

    "biography": "Charles Ingham was born in Dublin in 1796, where he became a pupil of William Cumming, a portrait painter known for his likenesses of female subjects.  Following four years of study with Cumming, Ingham adopted his master's specialty.  Thus, when he left Ireland and moved to New York in 1816, he soon became known as that city's premier \"ladies' painter.\"  The highly finished style he employed throughout his career--one requiring numerous lengthy sittings--was thought to be particularly appropriate for depictions of women; men, it was said, were too busy to submit to his laborious process of repeated layers of glazing.  In general, his portraits (some of which, despite the typing of his work along lines of gender, were of men) were warm in coloring and noticeably painstaking in draftsmanship.  He also produced miniatures and an occasional landscape and history painting.In New York, Ingham was extremely active in artists' organizations. Initially a member of the American Academy of Fine Arts, he became a founder of the National Academy of Design when it arose in opposition to the older body in 1826.  Although already a professional artist, he enrolled as a student in the antique school during the first season of the new organization; years later he returned for additional study in its life school (1844-1845).  His involvement with and support of the National Academy--often as an officer--was unflagging, except for a period during the 1850s, when his views on expanding the membership conflicted with the majority. Ingham was of the opinion that limits should be maintained on the number of artist-members, so as to make the group more exclusive. When his view was not upheld, he went so far as to bring suit against the Academy, greatly offending his fellow artists.  Such headstrong actions were said to be characteristic of the impulsive painter.Ingham was also described, however, as eminently sociable.  He was a founder, for example, of the Sketch Club (serving as its first president) and of the Century Association.  His contacts extended beyond New York, for he exhibited sporadically in Philadelphia, Washington, Albany, and Brooklyn as well.  Boston was another city which knew his work; he spent the winter of 1842-1843 there.  In addition, Ingham developed an amateur's interest in architecture.  At least one of his projects--a grandiose stairway for the National Academy--was executed, and he published an architectural essay, \"Public Monuments to Great Men,\" in 1858.  During the final years of his life, however, he suffered from ill health, which prompted him to scale back many of these activities.  He died in New York City in 1863.

    "biography": "Horace Vernet was born in Paris in 1789 and was predestined for art by family inheritance: the grandson of the engraver Jean Moreau le Jeune (1741-1814) on his mother's side and, on his father's, of Joseph Vernet (1714-1789), France's foremost painter of land- and seascapes, he was casually trained by his father, Carle Vernet (1758-1836), the witty chronicler of the elegancies of the post-Revolutionary decades and the empire. A prodigy in his childhood, a professional in his teens, he was spurred by financial needs arising from his early marriage in 1811 to exploit his phenomenal native facility. A torrent of saleable work soon poured from his studio: fashion designs, caricatures, portraits, horses in the manner of Carle, and landscapes in the manner of Joseph. In 1814 he was among the civilian defenders of Paris against the approaching allies, an episode he later represented in La Barrière de Clichy (1820, Louvre). In the early years of the Restoration, his studio became the meeting place of artists and veterans openly hostile to the Bourbon government. Much to that government's irritation, he flaunted his cult of Napoleon and found a patron in Louis-Philippe, duc d'Orléans, head of the disaffected cadet branch of the dynasty. A resolute modernist but little affected by romanticism, he befriended Gericault and was one of the Pioneers of lithography. In a series of battle scenes from the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, Jemmapes, Montmirail, Hanau, and Valmy, painted for the duc d'Orléans in 1821-1826 (National Gallery, London), he gave a foretaste of what was to become his speciality. His discreetly conciliatory gestures to the government had meanwhile been gratefully received and were producing prompt results. In short order, he was made an officier of the Legion of Honor (1825), a member of the Institute (1826), and after successes at the Salons of 1826 and 1827 was appointed director of the French Academy in Rome (1829). During his seven years there, he displayed an agile versatility with paintings of Italian popular life (Tbe Brigand's Confession), oriental subjects (Tbe Arab Story-teller), and historical anecdotes (Encounter of Raphael and Michelangelo in the Vatican). The Revolution in July 1830, which raised Louis-Philippe, Vernet's patron, to the throne, opened vast opportunities of official employment to him. The rapid flow of state commissions for battle pieces that now came his way taxed even his prodigious facility. Four very large canvases for the Galerie des Batailles at Versailles, shown at the Salon of 1836, were followed by a second series in 1841. Accepting his calling as that of a painter of modern national subjects, specifically of scenes of combat, Vernet conceived of his work as a form of eyewitness reportage that required observation at the actual theaters of war. In five long visits to North Africa (1833, 1837, 1839-1840, 1845, 1853), he gathered on-the-spot documentation of the French conquests in Algiers and Morocco, material that he later worked up into wall-size canvases destined for Versailles. Louis-Philippe's overthrow by the Revolution of 1848 and the advent of Napoleon III in 1849 scarcely affected his activity. The year 1850 found him at the French siege of Rome; in 1854 he visited the battlefields of the Crimea. He had in the meantime enjoyed the lucrative patronage of Czar Nicholas I during two long visits to Russia in 1836 and 1842-1843.The Universal Exposition of 1855, at which he was represented by twenty-four paintings, crowned his popular and official success. His reputation among artists and critics, on the other hand, was not uncontested. Baudelaire scathingly referred to him as \"un militaire qui fait de la peinture,\" and while his painstaking factuality and the sheer magnitude of his production commanded respect, the prosy shallowness of his realism, his stylistic banality, and the stridency of his chauvinism were early noted and contributed to the eventual neglect of his work. At the time of his death in 1863, Vernet, a member of thirty academies, was nevertheless France's most famous artist, admired and imitated throughout Europe and deeply imbedded in popular culture.

As the eleventh of fourteen children of John McCurdy and Elizabeth McLellan Smith, Royall successfully survived a childhood of limited financial means and some illness to become a successful artisan.Between 1830 and 1837, Royall Brewster Smith executed some three dozen portraits of residents of southern Maine.  As an itinerant, he painted subjects from such towns as Limington, Gorham, and Saco, all located within twenty-five miles of each other. Many of these sitters were from related families, some of them connected to Smith's own.  There is no indication that Smith ever received formal training.  Generally his works are three-quarter, half-length views on simple but brightly colored backgrounds.  The careful lettering of inscriptions on his paintings suggest that Smith may have worked as a sign painter as well as an artist.In 1840 he married Roxana Gowen in the town of Gorham.  By 1843 the couple had moved to Bangor, where Smith worked as a carpenter and painter until his death in December 1855.

    "biography": "Robert Street was born in 1796 in Germantown, Pennsylvania, the grandson of an English immigrant who had mistakenly been disinherited.  His activity as an artist is undocumented until 1815, when he exhibited a painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.  He exhibited there sporadically until 1861.  Between 1821 and 1823 he achieved a measure of success by exhibiting four large biblical and subject scenes (including The Infuriated Maniac Assaulting his Keeper) at a number of locations in Philadelphia, and several other American cities.  In 1824 he exhibited three historical paintings in Washington, D.C., and painted a portrait of Andrew Jackson (Sedalia Public Library, Missouri).  Later that year he ceased painting historical subjects and began to concentrate on portraiture.In 1834 Dunlap erroneously reported that \"Street of Philadelphia, aimed at historical composition and died in Washington city.\"  After receiving a corrective letter from the artist, Dunlap published a notice in the New York Mirror (28 February 1835) and announced that Street was alive and \"prosperously pursuing his art in Philadelphia.\"  Street was an active member of the Artists' Fund Society.  In 1840 he organized an exhibition of 172 of his own paintings, along with his personal collection of \"old masters,\" that was held at the Artists' Fund Hall in Philadelphia.  He also exhibited at the Apollo Association in New York, in 1838 and 1839, and at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, in 1847 and 1851.  Street had six children by three wives, at least four of whom became artists.  He died in Philadelphia in 1865.Although Street was chiefly a portraitist, he also painted landscapes and still lifes.  He excelled in the difficult task of posthumous portraiture.  Street's style, which remained fairly constant throughout his long career, was characterized by its naive, linear quality, and tentative grasp of perspective and anatomical draftsmanship.  Despite strong competition from more sophisticated portraitists such as Thomas Sully, John Neagle, Jacob Eichholtz, and James Reid Lambdin, he enjoyed liberal patronage in Philadelphia.

    "biography": "Thomas Doughty was born in Philadelphia on 19 July 1791, as recorded in the records of the Old St. George Methodist Episcopal Church, and lived there until 1828.  Although little is known about his formal education, he apparently showed a strong talent for drawing from an early age.  When he was fifteen or sixteen Doughty was apprenticed to a leather worker, and by 1814 he was listed in the Philadelphia directory as a \"currier.\"  However, two years later he was cited as a \"painter\" and he exhibited a landscape at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.  Doughty's early career as an artist seems to have met with little success, and from 1818 to 1819 he was working once again as a leather currier.  He continued to paint during these years and finally, in 1820, decided to make landscape painting his full-time career.Doughty was largely self-trained, and he relied heavily on copying European landscapes which he saw in collections such as that of his early patron Robert Gilmor, Jr., of Baltimore.  From these he learned the established conventions of Continental landscape painting, which he then applied to American scenes.  He made sketching trips to record details for his paintings, which came to be much admired for their comparative realism and truth to nature. Doughty was thus one of the founders of the native American landscape school, and his works from the 1820s recorded the beauties of the scenery of the eastern United States.  Yet he was never simply a topographical painter, for he classified some his works as \"from nature,\" and others as \"from recollection,\" or \"composition[s].\"In 1828 Doughty moved to Boston, but he had resumed residence in Philadelphia by 1830.  From 1830 to 1832 he edited a monthly magazine with his brother John, called The Cabinet of Natural History and American Rural Sports.  This included hand-colored lithographs by Doughty of various types of animals.  The magazine ceased publication in 1832, and Doughty returned to Boston, remaining there for five profitable years.  During this time he exhibited frequently and also taught drawing and painting.  His works from this period, such as the NGA's Fanciful Landscape (1963.9.2), proved extremely popular although they were less realistic and more romantic than his earlier efforts.  Writing in 1834, William Dunlap, the first historian of American art, considered Doughty \"in the first rank as a landscape painter.\"Although he spent the majority of his life in his native land, Doughty did journey abroad, going to England for a brief stay in 1838.  He visited England, Ireland, and France between 1845 and 1847.  The last years of his life were spent in New York, and after 1853 Doughty painted only rarely.  Although the artist usually managed to find buyers for his works, he was continually short of money, and when he died on July 22, 1856, he and his family were apparently living in near poverty.

    "biography": "Edward Hicks was born in 1780 in Attleborough (now Langhorne), Pennsylvania, into a family that had suffered severe financial losses during the Revolution.  After Edward's mother died in 1781, he was raised by a Quaker family named Twining.Hicks apparently had no scholarly interests and at the age of thirteen was apprenticed to the Tomlinson brothers, coachmakers in Attleborough.  This marked the beginning of his training as an artisan.  This apprenticeship furnished him with the technical skills he would apply to the easel paintings he executed fairly late in his life.  Hicks briefly set up his own business in 1800 but closed it to help a Northampton, Pennsylvania, doctor build a new kind of carriage.  Religious discussions with this employer increased Hicks' awareness of his Quaker roots.  After a severe illness, his lively character became more introspective, and he began attending Quaker meetings.Hicks moved to Milford (now Hulmeville), Pennsylvania, in 1801 to work for another coachmaker and painter; two years later he married Sarah Worstall, a childhood friend, with whom he had four children.  Hicks at this time was painting signs, furniture, coaches, lettering, and floor cloths, but he became increasingly interested in the Quaker ministry.  He set out on the first of his many preaching trips in 1811, the same year he moved his family to Newtown, Pennsylvania.  His sermons reportedly attracted crowds, and he was described as one of the most popular and leading ministers of his time.  From this point on his religious interest would dominate his life.  Nonetheless, he continued painting, which he described as \"one of those trifling insignificant arts\" and principally a way to \"get an honest living.\"  He briefly left the painting trade for farming in 1813 but had returned to it by 1815, when he began to produce elaborate signs with the help of several assistants.In 1820 Hicks visited his cousin Elias Hicks, a principal figure in the theological rift that split the Quakers in 1827.  Edward joined his cousin's Hicksite movement and remained a passionate defender of its tenets.  Several of his paintings reveal how profoundly this controversy affected the artist's life.  Elias Hicks appears in all of the canvases, and two of them include a verbal allusion to Hicksite doctrine.Hicks' religious concerns, however strong in the 1830s, did not totally eclipse his artistic life.  While he continued to paint variations on the Quaker theme of peace and brotherly love throughout his life, as exemplified by his more than sixty versions of the Peaceable Kingdom, he also apparently offered artistic instruction.  Hicks reportedly taught his younger cousin Thomas Hicks, and the Bucks County Intelligencer in 1864 reported that, as a youth, the academic painter Martin Johnson Heade was \"placed under the instruction of Edward Hicks...to be taught the art of painting.\"The paintings from the 1840s, the last decade of Hicks' life, are considered his best and include the National Gallery's The Grave of William Penn (1980.62.12), The Cornell Farm (1964.23.4) and later Peaceable Kingdoms.  Edward Hicks died August 23, 1849.  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "John Toole, whose name was originally O'Toole, was born in Dublin, Ireland, on 26 November 1815 to Jane O'Toole and Michael O'Toole, a chemistry teacher.  After his father's death as a result of an explosive experiment, John immigrated to the United States in 1827, along with his brother and sister.  They were sent to live with an aunt and uncle who were established in Charlottesville, Virginia, the uncle as a tailor or shoemaker.Facts regarding Toole's early education and artistic training are elusive.  He was already painting by 1832 or 1833, during a stay in Harpers Ferry, Virginia.  A large number of surviving letters to and from his wife provide more detailed biographical information about his later years--more than is usually available on the life of an itinerant painter.In 1836 Toole married Mary Jane Suddarth (1817-1902), who came from a family distantly related to Thomas Jefferson.  They settled in North Garden, near Charlottesville, and eventually had six children.  John may have become a druggist or tavern-keeper for a short time after his marriage.  He returned to painting by 1838, and it was to remain his sole source of livelihood from then on.  Toole traveled through Virginia and its environs mostly painting portraits, with varying degrees of financial success, until his death in Charlottesville on 11 March 1860.  His family then moved to Washington, D.C.There is no evidence other than family tradition that Toole attended the University of Virginia.  He nevertheless seems to have been a person of some education.  Latin quotations appear in his letters, and his personal library contained both a French grammar book and a French edition of Voltaire's plays.Toole also had considerable artistic cultivation.  He studied and collected engravings based on the works of masters ranging from Bartolome Esteban Murillo to Benjamin West.  Two drawing books he owned may also have played a role in his self-education.  Wash drawings after Raphael cartoons demonstrate Toole's interest in the grand tradition of European history painting.  The artist's best-known venture into this genre is The Capture of Major Andre.Toole's major source of income, as for most itinerant nineteenth-century paintings, was the making of portraits.  Nearly one hundred portraits, including drawings and miniatures, are attributable to him on the basis of style and provenance, although he never dated his work and in only one case signed it.  A comparison of his painted portraits with extant daguerreotypes of a number of his sitters demonstrates that Toole's likenesses were accurate.The introduction of photography caused a crisis in Toole's career.  He attempted to come to terms with this new technique and is known to have executed portraits from daguerreotypes as early as 1857.  He even worked with a photographer in Virginia, attempting to combine portrait painting and photography.  This venture, however, proved unsuccessful.In addition to portraits and occasional historical subjects, four landscapes by Toole are extant, one of which is the National Gallery's Skating Scene (1958.9.6), attributed to Toole on the basis of its provenance in his family.

    "biography": "Henry Inman's father was an English-born brewer who settled near Utica, New York, and it was there that the future artist was born in 1801, raised, and educated.  Aside from primary schooling, Inman also received some artistic instruction in his native town from an itinerant portrait painter.  After the family moved to New York City in 1812, he continued his study of drawing.  His important training, however, began two years later when he was accepted for a seven-year apprenticeship by John Wesley Jarvis, at that time the premier portrait painter in New York.  During the course of his term with Jarvis, Inman accompanied him on several painting trips, notably to New Orleans, and assumed responsibility for the backgrounds and drapery of his master's works.  He soon learned to paint miniatures, and his first large oil portrait was executed in 1817.  Consequently, by the time his apprenticeship ended in 1821, he was more than ready to launch his own career.Inman settled in New York, marrying Jane O'Brien in 1822.  Although a recent student himself, he soon took on George Twibill and Thomas S. Cummings as pupils.  With the latter he formed a portrait-painting partnership which lasted until 1828.  (Later he would teach William Sidney Mount, Daniel Huntington, and his master's son, Charles Wesley Jarvis.)  In addition to portraits, he began painting an occasional genre picture, and eventually his catholic interests would also embrace landscape.  With Cummings, Inman was instrumental in forming the National Academy of Design; in 1826 he became its first vice president.  Inman became closely identified with the Academy, studying for two years in its antique school and exhibiting there every year for the rest of his life--sometimes with as many as 18 works in a single show.  Publicly visible, he became the member most often singled out for vituperative newspaper criticism by the Academy's early enemies.Inman often contributed illustrations to gift books, but in 1831 he increased his involvement in the print industry by moving to Philadelphia, where he had set up a partnership with lithographer Cephas G. Childs a year earlier.  He continued to paint portraits, however, competing with Thomas Sully for commissions in Philadelphia and making short trips to Baltimore and New York.  For a time he lived on a farm that he purchased across the river from Philadelphia, in Mt. Holly, New Jersey, but in 1834 he sold his real estate and returned to New York.  These years were busy for Inman, filled with teaching, large numbers of commissioned portraits, and a major project of copying over 100 paintings of Native Americans (the originals were mainly by Charles Bird King) for lithographic reproduction.  The copies later traveled as a separate exhibition.During a prosperous period, Inman had engaged in land speculation, but following the Panic of 1837, he found himself in unexpected financial difficulty.  This, coupled with his chronic asthma and failing health, turned his final years into something of a struggle.  In addition, a younger generation of New York portrait painters--including Huntington and Charles Loring Elliott--was becoming increasingly popular, winning ever more commissions.In 1844, he took a long-deferred trip to England, accompanied by a daughter.  Although his health did not improve, he was able to execute a group of portraits in London and study the landscape in Scotland and northern England.  He returned to New York in 1845, but following a period of two months in his sickbed, he died in 1846.  Left unexecuted at his death was his commission of a large work, The Emigration of Daniel Boone to Kentucky for the Capitol rotunda.  (He had been paid $6000, but had never moved beyond a few early studies).  Inman was accorded a lengthy, ceremonial funeral procession through the streets of Manhattan, and a month later an unusual memorial exhibition of 126 of his paintings earned nearly $2000 for his widow and six children.  One son, John O'Brien Inman, later became an artist.  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "Jules-Louis-Philippe Coignet was born in 1798.  He studied with the influential neoclassical landscape painter Jean Victor Bertin (1767-1842) and in 1821 was among the competitors for the Rome Prize in Historical Landscape. From 1824 until 1857 he regularly exhibited at the Paris Salon, winning a gold medal in 1824 with View of the Gulf of Salerno (lost). A constant traveler in search of picturesque motifs, not unlike his contemporary Corot, he carried his explorations as far as Egypt and Syria.  Although he had begun as a painter in the tradition of the composed, \"historical\" landscape, his Salon submissions were for the most part topographical views, based on oil studies painted out-of-doors. In these studies, the raw material from which he developed his exhibition pieces, he showed himself a fluent colorist, sensitive to effects of light and atmosphere: in short, a naturalist, whose painterly, observation-based work contains no trace of neoclassical stylization. Unlike other landscapists formed, like himself, in the school of Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes (175O-1819), Bertin,and Achille-Etna Michallon (1796-1822), he did not construct his landscapes piecemeal by an addition of parts but aimed from the outset for the entire image. His preliminary studies from nature already present encompassing views of the chosen sites in their proper illumination. In his finished paintings, his reliance on direct experience allowed him to dispense with the fictions by which other painters sought to heighten the significance of their landscapes. His Salon submissions contained no mythical or historical motifs. Though he was partial to evocative sites, as exemplified by one of his most successful works, Temple of Poseidon (1844, Neue Pinakothek, Munich), he rarely gave way to romantic exaggeration. It may have been this abstention from both classicist elevation and romantic drama that caused his paintings to be slighted by the critics, despite his popularity with the middle-class public in France and Germany. A prolific and careful draftsman, Coignet produced a large body of pencil drawings (many of them now at the Musée d'Art of Clermont-Ferrand) that deal in a fairly prosaic way with topographic views and landscape details such as trees, shrubbery, and rocks. Some of these were intended for lithographic reproduction in the books on landscape that Coignet published.  He died in 1860.

He evinced an early interest for art, and at the age of fifteen saw an exhibition of portraits by Ezra Ames at Albany.  In 1822 he saw in Utica some biblical scenes by William Dunlap, from whom he received some informal instruction.  In 1825 Spencer went to New York City and drew from the casts at the American Academy of the Fine Arts, where he studied under John Trumbull.  By 1827 he had returned to his family's home in Canastota and commenced painting portraits.After periods of professional activity in Albany and Utica, he returned to New York City in 1831 and became a successful portraitist who painted many of New York's prominent citizens.  In 1834 Dunlap reported that Spencer \"has been in constant employment to the present time, and with increasing reputation.\" He became an academician of the American Academy in 1832, and served on its board directors from 1833 to 1835.  He became an associate member of the National Academy of Design in 1837, a full academician in 1846, and corresponding secretary of the organization from 1849 to 1850, when he refused reelection in order to dedicate himself to painting.  In 1858 the artist retired to upstate New York; he evidently experienced some marital difficulties at that time because his wife, without apparent justification, accused him of insanity and remained in New York City.  Spencer died at Wampsville on April 3, 1875.Spencer painted in an extremely smooth, linear style characterized by a high degree of finish; his later works appear almost photographic.  A provincial portraitist who specialized in conventional and literal likenesses, Spencer also painted genre and literary subjects.

    "biography": "Charles David was born in 1797 in Cadenet near Avignon (Vaucluse), the son of a goldsmith and musician. His younger brother, Félicien David (1810-1876), became well known in France as a composer of symphonies and operas. Charles followed a more modest career. After promising art studies at Avignon and Dijon, he enlisted in the army as a bandsman, participated in the French campaign in Spain of 1823, and ended his military service as trombonist in the regimental band of the Royal Cuirassiers. On returning to civilian life, he settled in Paris as a painter of landscapes, portraits, and miniatures. He had chosen to live at 9, quai d'Anjou, the building on the Ile Saint-Louis in which Honoré Daumier lived and worked in the 1840s and that had become a meeting place for artists and writers of the romantic generation. The subject of David's only known submission to a Paris Salon, View of the Ponds at Ville-d'Avray, exhibited in 1847, strongly suggests that he was acquainted with Camille Corot, Daumier's friend, who regularly worked at Ville-d'Avray. The Revolution of 1848 caused David to return to his native province. Earning his living as a painter of miniatures, he occasionally exhibited his larger portraits and landscapes at Aix and Avignon.  By his eccentricities, his exuberant good humor, and his arcane studies of the mystery of perpetual motion, he achieved considerable local celebrity. Very little is now known of his work. He died in Avignon in 1869.  [This is the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "Remembered widely for his pioneering work in optics and astronomy, Alvan Clark is less well known as an artist, although he is thought to have executed some 500 oil portraits and miniatures during his lifetime.  Clark was born in in 1804 in Ashfield, Massachusetts, where he spent his early years on his father's farm, working at the family mill.  After a brief stint in a wagon-maker's shop, he took up drawing and engraving, spending the winter season of 1824 in Boston, where he was encouraged by moderate professional success.Returning to his home in western Massachusetts, he began itinerant work in the Connecticut River Valley as a painter of watercolor and ink portraits.  By late 1825, however, he secured employment as an engraver of cylinders for printing calico patterns.  For the next ten years he labored within the booming textile industry, initially in Lowell, Massachusetts, and later in Providence, Rhode Island, New York City, and Fall River, Massachusetts.  During these years, Clark also studied painting, exhibiting miniatures for the first time at the National Academy of Design, New York, in 1829, and at the Boston Athenaeum in 1830.  By 1836 he had ended his career as an engraver and moved to the Boston area, where he relied on miniature commissions for his livelihood.  For over two decades he continued to paint portraits, increasingly in oil, maintaining a studio in Boston and a home in nearby Cambridgeport.Concurrent with Clark's artistic development was a growing interest in science and mechanics.  In 1840, for example, he patented a \"false loading muzzle\" for rifles, which greatly increased accuracy and diminished the time needed between shots.  The turning point in his life, however, came several years later, when an increased popular interest in astronomy followed the appearance of the Great Comet of 1843.  In an effort to help his older son construct a small telescope, Clark taught himself to grind and polish a glass refracting lens.  Working outside of established scientific communities, he and his two sons, George Bassett and Alvan Graham Clark, gradually improved their understanding of optics and refined their technique until they became the preeminent manufacturers of telescope lenses in the world.  Eventually, the firm of Alvan Clark & Sons became suppliers to all the major observatories in North America and Europe.The painter's growing success in optics led in 1860 to a commission worth thousands of dollars for an unprecedented 18 1/2-inch lens, prompting him to close his portrait studio.  He then purchased a large compound on the Charles River, building a factory and three houses for himself and his sons.  Although he was renowned internationally for his work with lenses and his discoveries of new stars, it is reported that he preferred to dwell on his career as an artist, insisting that visitors to his factory also view his work in portraiture.  Several years before his death in in 1887 in Cambridge, Clark finally resumed his earlier vocation, taking up his brushes again to execute several family portraits.

In 1826 an oxcart fell on him, paralyzing him from the waist down, and in 1832, on the advice of his physician, he began to study art so that he might make a living. His teacher was Franklin White, a pupil of Chester Harding (1792-1866).In 1834, when Stock was commissioned by Dr. James Swan to do a series of anatomical drawings, the doctor constructed a wheelchair which enabled the artist to sit up and move about his parents' home.  The chair could be lifted on and off trains, and soon Stock was accepting portrait commissions in neighboring and more distant towns.  In 1837 he worked in Stafford, Connecticut, for several weeks.  After surviving a life-threatening hip operation in 1839, he went to Warren and Bristol, Rhode Island, in 1842; New Bedford, Massachusetts, in 1842-1843; Middletown and Goshen, New York, in 1852-1853; and Port Jervis, New York, his last place of work, in 1854.  Between his travels he worked in rented studios in Springfield.  It is unusually fortunate that Stock kept a diary of his activities and commissions for fourteen years.  This rare documentation not only describes Stock's career, but provides great insights into the lives nineteenth-century itinerant portrait painters in general.In addition to the full-length portraits of children at which he excelled and the half-length portraits of adults, Stock painted miniatures and a few landscape and genre scenes. He also sold boxes, clocks, and frames ornamented with shells, and toward the end of his career he copied daguerreotypes.  His journal records that from 1832 to 1846 he executed over 912 paintings and left an additional 85 to 95 among his possessions at his death.Stock died of tuberculosis in 1855 at the age of forty, in the city where he was born.

    "biography": "John Woodhouse Audubon, second son of the artist/naturalist John James Audubon, was born on November 30, 1812, in Henderson, Kentucky.  At an early age he showed artistic promise and was encouraged to join his father in his scientific interests. While his brother Victor Gifford (1809-1860) assisted with the business and record-keeping functions related to the various Audubon publications, John Woodhouse was an active traveler and collector of specimens, as well as a draftsman.  In 1833 he accompanied his father on an expedition to Labrador.  Later that same year John James was able to write, \"John has drawn a few Birds, as good as any I ever made, and in a few months I hope to give this department of my duty up to him altogether.\"While the Audubon family was in London in 1834, both sons studied painting, John apparently making portraits and copies of works by Sir Henry Raeburn (1756-1823) and Bartolome Esteban Murillo (1617-1682).  By this time the senior Audubon's projects had become family enterprises.  John Woodhouse traveled to Florida and Texas in 1837 on collecting missions.  He would return to the Southwest nine years later to gather specimens of mammals as well as birds. During the years 1839-1843 John Woodhouse was chiefly responsible for the production of the second version of The Birds of America, overseeing the reduction of 500 plates to their smaller size and working with the lithographer.  Within a few years he also painted, in oil, half of the subjects used as illustrations in The Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America (1845-1848) and supervised the printing of all of the plates.  In 1856 he published a second reduced-size edition of The Birds of America and in 1860 began to produce a second, folio size edition of it, this time by lithography rather than engraving.  Because many of the subscribers to the latter were Southern, the venture was ruined by the Civil War.Both John and Victor Audubon built homes on the land surrounding their parents' house in New York.  John had nine children, two by his first wife, Maria Rebecca Bachman, daughter of the Rev. John Bachman (collaborator on the Quadrupeds), and seven by his second wife, Caroline Hall.  He exhibited portraits as well as animal paintings in New York throughout the 1840s and 1850s, at the Apollo Association, American Art-Union, and National Academy of Design.  He died in 1862.

    "biography": "Although the details of Abram Ross Stanley's life are not certain, he was probably born March 16, 1816, in Salisbury, Herkimer County, New York, to Jedediah and Prudence Stanley, who had moved there six years earlier from New Hampshire.  Based on his middle name, the artist is sometimes identified as a descendant of Betsy Ross, but there is no evidence to support this claim.  Stanley began two years of study with an Italian artist in 1830 and soon after established himself as a portraitist.  He is recorded as having taken a long hiatus from painting beginning in 1842; indeed, the 1850 New York State census lists his profession as goldsmith, perhaps reflecting his inability to support his young family solely on his earnings as an artist.Stanley and his family moved permanently to Shullsburg, Wisconsin, shortly after 1850--probably in 1853.  Stanley's working life, like that of many naive painters, was marked by variety, and in Shullsburg he became the town postmaster.  The 1860 Wisconsin census gives his occupation as jeweler, and not until 1870 is he recorded as a portrait painter.  The date of his last known work is 1873, and Stanley died in Shullsburg on June 23, 1875.

    "biography": "Jean-François Millet was born in 1814 in the Norman village of Gruchy, the eldest child in a large, closely knit family of farmers living in modest prosperity on their own land. His parents, religious and patriarchal, saw to it that he received a good education, which gave him a knowledge of Latin and a lifelong interest in literature. Having shown early signs of talent, the youth was sent to Cherbourg in 1833 to work with a local portrait painter, Bon Dumouchel (1807-1846). Two years later, he entered the studio of Lucien-Théophile Langlois (1803-1845), a former pupil of Antoine-Jean Gros (1771-1835). In 1837, provided with a stipend by the city of Cherbourg, Millet went to Paris, to enroll at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts as the pupil of the history painter Paul Delaroche (1797-1856), then at the height of his celebrity. After two unhappy years of study, Millet competed unsuccessfully for the Rome Prize, left his teacher, and lost his stipend. Back in Cherbourg, he set himself up as a portrait painter.  One of his portraits was accepted for the Paris Salon of 1840, but another, commissioned by the city of Cherbourg, was returned to him as a poor likeness. Discouraged, Millet decided to seek better luck in Paris, where he established himself with his wife, the frail Pauline-Virginie Ono, barely twenty years old. His portraits of that time, modeled in hard contrasts of light and shadow (Portrait of Mademoiselle Ono, c.1841, Musée Thomas-Henry, Cherbourg), are indebted to the Spanish painters whose work he was able to study in the Galerie Espagnole at the Louvre. While he struggled for a livelihood, his wife contracted tuberculosis and died. Millet returned to Cherbourg in 1844 and here took as his companion a servant girl of eighteen, Catherine Lemaire. To reach a wider audience, he produced ingratiating bucolic idylls, using a technique of flecked touches of light color, his manière fleurie, a concession to a popular revival of rococo style to which his friend Narcisse Diaz de la Peña may have introduced him. Sensing the disapproval of his Cherbourg relations, he moved with his mistress to Le Havre and thence to Paris (1846), where he continued to woo the public with mildly erotic compositions. But in his drawings for them he already gave proof of greater energy and seriousness than was called for by these slight inventions (The Lovers, c. 1848, Art Institute of Chicago).Millet took no active part in the Revolution of 1848. At the unjuried Salon of that year, he exhibited The Grain Sifter (1847-1848, National Gallery, London), one of his earliest scenes of farm labor, which met with a favorable critical reaction. He now became acquainted with several of the artists who were to form what came to be known as the School of Barbizon, Théodore Rousseau 1812-1867), Charles-Emile Jacque (1813-1894), and the sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye (1795-1875). He also met Honoré Daumier (1808-1879) about this time, when both artists competed unsuccessfully in the contest for an allegorical painting of the Republic.An outbreak of cholera in Paris prompted Millet in 1849 to join his new friends at Barbizon. From this time on, he devoted himself mainly to subjects from rural life. At the Salon of 1850-1851, his Sower (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) attracted both praise and ridicule by its novelty in endowing farm labor with symbolic nobility. Popularized by countless reproductions, it came in time to signify Creative Man. In the following years, Millet continued to treat scenes of rural work in an elevated style. Harvesters Resting (1853, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) cast its subject as a modern version of the story of Ruth and Boaz. At the Salon of 1857, The Gleaners (Louvre), a composition of grand dignity, nevertheless came under attack because some saw a subversive intent in its image of rural poverty. While the picture was on view, Millet received a commission from the American painter Thomas Appleton (1812-1884) for what was to become in later years his most famous painting, The Angelus (1859, Louvre). During the 1860s his work began to attract the attention of a widening circle of critics and collectors, not a few of them Americans. At the Salon of 1863 his Man with a Hoe (c. 1862, The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles) caused a controversy between indignant journalists who denounced this portrayal of an exhausted laborer as subhuman and cretinous and admirers who saw in it a tribute to stoic endurance of unrewarded toil.Millet and his family lived as frugally as their neighbors. In 1863 Catherine gave birth to their ninth child. His breakthrough to success came at the Salon of 1864, where the youth and near prettiness of his Shepherdess Guarding Her Flock (Louvre) won the hearts of the public who concluded that he had at last overcome his addiction to scenes of misery and discovered charm. He was awardeda first-class medal. Landscape, which had played a minor role in his work, now came to dominate it. Unlike his fellow painters at Barbizon, he did not respond to the forests and rocky deserts of Fontainebleau, preferring man-made agricultural landscapes that perhaps reminded him of his childhood in Normandy. The area around Barbizon furnished him with a sparse repertoire of motifs which he enriched by recollections of Normandy and by studies gathered in the more varied, hilly countrysides of the Auvergne, where he made several stays in the 1860s for the sake of his wife's health. In some of his later landscapes there appears an undercurrent of emotional tension that disturbs their formal structure and foreshadows the turbulent late landscapes of Vincent van Gogh, an admirer of his work.In his rural seclusion at Barbizon, Millet still maintained lively intellectual contacts with literary and artistic friends, read the classics, advised his friend and later biographer Alfred Sensier on questions of art, and formed a collection of engravings, medals, and ceramics. At the Paris Universal Exposition of 1867 he was impressively represented by nine paintings, among them The Gleaners and The Angelus, which had earned him the cross of the Legion of Honor in 1865. When war with Prussia broke out in 1870, he found refuge in his native Normandy, waiting out the siege of Paris and the civil war that followed. He refused association with the Commune and its Federation of Artists. Late in 1871 he returned to Barbizon. Through his dealer Durand-Ruel, who had immigrated to London, he sent paintings abroad for exhibition and sale in Europe and America. Their success signaled his acceptance by the international public.Childhood memories, refreshed by impressions of his wartime stay in Normandy, furnished him material for many of the landscapes that he completed after his return to Barbizon (The Church of Gréville, 1871-1874, Louvre). Among his projects of the postwar years was the completion of a landscape cycle, begun in 1868, representing the seasons of the year in their natural and agricultural aspects (Spring, 1868-1873, Louvre). One of his last finished works, The Bird Nesters (1874, Philadelphia Museum of Art), was a nocturnal vision of torch-lit, violent action that contrasted strangely with the stillness of his earlier paintings of rural life. Ailing in 1875, he married his common-law wife in accordance with the rites of the church (a civil wedding had been performed in 1853). He died on 20 January and was buried in the churchyard at Barbizon, beside Théodore Rousseau.Because it dwells on an aspect of social reality, the lives of peasants, Millet's work is usually assigned to the current of nineteenth-century realism. But in its treatment of that reality it is neither strictly modern nor visually objective. Guided by memories of art, Millet idealized the condition and appearance of the French peasantry. Like Daumier, he had an eye for statuesque corporeality and for the telling gesture, but while Daumier's stylizations accentuated the individual, Millet limited himself to the typical.  His modernity and originality lay, not in his choice of subjects, nor even in the depth of feeling he brought to them, but in his formal qualities, the power of his drawing and the boldness of his pictorial invention.

    "biography": "Sturtevant J. Hamblin, son of Almery and Sally Clark Hamblin, listed his profession as a portrait painter between 1841 and 1856.  He came from a family of artisans which included his grandfather, George Hamblin, who was a painter and glazer, his father, and his brothers Nathaniel, Joseph G., and Eli.  Sturtevant's sister Rosamund married the itinerant portrait painter William Matthew Prior in 1928, and Sturtevant may have become his brother-in-law's pupil.  Sturtevant resided for several years with the Priors; he is recorded for the first time as living \"at Wm. Prior's\" in 1837, the date used by scholars as his beginning active date, despite the fact that his first signed work dates from 1841.  About three years later both families moved to Boston.  In 1841 Sturtevant Hamblin and William Prior are recorded living in Nathaniel Hamblin's house on 12 Chambers Street.  The following year they moved to Marion Street in East Boston; they lived there together until 1844.  Three of the Hamblins advertised as house, sign and fancy painters, and Sturtevant probably earned part of his living in this manner.  By 1846 William Prior established his own residence on Trenton Street, East Boston, where he lived until his death in 1873.  While the Hamblins continued working in the painting business, only Sturtevant is known to have considered himself a portrait painter.  By 1856, however, he evidently became dissatisfied with his painting career and entered into a partnership in \"Gent's Furnishings\" with his brother Joseph.Because Sturtevant Hamblin rarely signed his paintings, and his brother-in-law was such a prolific and popular artist, many works attributed to Prior may have been executed by Hamblin.  Careful stylistic comparison of Prior-Hamblin portraits with existing signed Hamblins has more firmly established the artist's individual style and illumated a larger portion of his oeuvre.

    "biography": "John Bradley is an artist whose oeuvre can be well documented through signed works, many of which are dated or inscribed with a street address. Biographical data is, however, more elusive, although he is known to have been active between 1827 and 1847. Neither his birth nor death dates are known, but the inscriptions on the versos of his five Totten family portraits, \"Drawn by I. Bradley from Great Britton,\" indicate his country of origin. The discovery in England in 2005 of three paintings inscribed \"I Bradley\" followed by Suffolk locations and dated 1827 (a cow in a field) and 1830 (a pair of portraits), provide a possible clue to the area in England from where the artist came, and indicate that the he did not come to America until 1830 or later. Bradley's earliest paintings show the sitters at full length and with many more accoutrements than in later paintings. Smaller than his subsequent works, they were probably painted while Bradley was in England.By late 1832 Bradley was on Staten Island (then Richmond Island), where he painted Asher Androvette, a prominent citizen of that borough. With this portrait, Bradley adopted the waist-length format he was to use for adult sitters in America. In the next few years, Bradley's artistic career can be traced through his renderings of other Richmond residents--the Coles, Tottens, and Ellises. In 1833 he painted New York merchant Simon Content and his wife. Efforts to trace Bradley's place of residence at this time through church and census records and local newspapers have not met with success. The 1835 New York State Census, however, lists a William Bradley of the Westfield area of the island--where the artist's early sitters resided--whose household contained three \"aliens,\" one of whom may possibly have been John Bradley.In the 1836 New York city directory, Bradley is listed as a \"portrait painter\" at 56 Hammersley Street. From 1837 to 1843 he is recorded at 128 Spring Street, and it is at this address that he executed the National Gallery painting as well as his only known miniature. Bradley's last address in New York, from 1844 to 1847, was 134 Spring Street.  Two portraits date from this period.  After these works, nothing further has been determined of Bradley's life or career.  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published in the NGA Systematic Catalogue; updated in 2013]",

    "biography": "One of the few mid-nineteenth-century painters to pursue a dual career in art and business, Francis Edmonds managed to become an influential figure in the interrelated spheres of banking, politics, and culture in New York City.  Edmonds was born in 1806 into a large family in Hudson, New York, where he received a Quaker education and early artistic encouragement from William Dunlap, an associate of his father and occasional guest in the house.  Dunlap and another itinerant painter introduced the boy to outdoor sketching, but when an anticipated apprenticeship with an engraver proved to be too costly, it was decided that he would follow his uncle into the banking business.In 1823 Edmonds became a clerk in the Tradesmen's Bank of New York City, where the assumption of his new duties forced him to put art studies aside for several years.  The opening of the schools of the National Academy of Design in 1826, however, prompted a renewed effort, and he registered as a student of the antique from 1827 to 1830.  His first finished oil painting, Hudibras Capturing the Fiddler (present location unknown) was accepted in the 1829 Academy Annual; it secured him membership as an associate.  Once again, though, his artistic career was interrupted by the demands of the banking trade.  Appointed cashier of the Hudson River Bank, Edmonds left New York for his native city, where he married Martha Norman, a local resident.  Although he returned to New York City in 1832 with a new position at the Leather Manufacturers' Bank, it would be another few years before he again found time for his painting.Eventually seeking instruction from William Page, he began to work up new compositions for submission to the National Academy.  An Edmonds painting first appeared again at an Academy Annual in 1836, although it was exhibited under an assumed name, supposedly because its author feared the condescension of his business colleagues, who would have frowned upon such artistic interests.  Soon, however, his activity within the New York art world increased considerably, and he took on leadership roles in the National Academy, the Apollo Association (later, the American Art Union), the Sketch Club, the New-York Gallery of the Fine Arts, the Century Club, and the Artists' Fund Society.  With the exception of 1841, when he was traveling throughout Europe following the death of his wife and his own subsequent nervous breakdown, he customarily produced several genre paintings annually, despite his full-time work as a banker. These were usually humorous, based on a literary theme, and executed in a manner derived from seventeenth-century Dutch or contemporary English sources.Artists' organizations prized Edmonds' involvement because of his business acumen and his extensive network of contacts with individuals capable of providing significant financial patronage. In addition to his banking interests, for example, he served as a director of several railroad and insurance corporations and was active in the Democratic party.  In 1854 he was appointed New York City Chamberlain, a position of political patronage that entrusted him with considerable control of municipal funds.  This increasing prominence, however, apparently backfired when Edmonds was publicly accused of embezzlement a year later.  Although he was never legally charged with criminal activities, the informal accusation was enough to prompt his resignation from his financial positions. Thereafter, he devoted much of the remainder of his life to developing a bank-note engraving company, improving his country estate in Bronxville, New York, and raising his large family (he had remarried after returning from Europe).  His genre painting, which continued throughout this period, shifted in later years toward rural themes, a likely reflection of his increasing remove from day-to-day affairs in New York City.  He died at his estate in 1863.  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "Bundy was an untrained painter who artfully recorded the likenesses of northern New Englanders.  He was born in Hardwick, Vermont, 22 July 1814, and there received his introduction to painting as a decorator of sleighs.  In 1837, while residing in Lowell, Massachusetts, he married Louisa Lockwood.  By 1841 the Bundys had moved into a house in North Springfield, Vermont, built for the couple by Louisa's father.  They had eight children.Bundy almost always signed and dated his portraits, often including a place of execution, thereby providing a record of his travels.  His itinerancy was likely as much a result of his religious calling as of his artistic one.  In 1842 he converted to the Advent faith and thereafter spent an increasing amount of time preaching throughout New England.  By 1850 he was painting, and certainly speaking as well, in Townshend, Vermont; Hancock, Nashua, and Fitzwilliam, New Hampshire; and Winchendon, Massachusetts.  He accepted portrait commissions through at least 1859 and was listed as a painter in the 1860 census of Springfield, Vermont.  In 1863 Bundy was appointed pastor of the Second Advent Church, Lakeport, New Hampshire, where he was recorded as an important leader.During the 1870s, while living in Concord, New Hampshire, the few portraits he produced were painted from photographs of family members.In 1883 Bundy journeyed to Jamaica, where he is reported to have executed several paintings for a wealthy planter and to have made studies of tropical scenery.  He died of typhus shortly after his return to the United States in the same year.

    "biography": "Two biographies of Honoré Daumier have been published by the National Gallery of Art in the systematic catalogues of its collection.  Both are given here.By Lorenz Eitner, in French Paintings of the Nineteenth Century. Part I: Before Impressionism, published 2000:Honoré Daumier's career was one of the most unusual in the history of nineteenth-century art. Famous in his time as France's best-known caricaturist, he remained unrecognized in his actual stature--as one of the period's most profoundly original and wide-ranging realists. Even today, his essential quality may not be fully understood; the marvels of his pictorial inventions are half-hidden in the profusion of his enormous lithographic work, the sharp truths of his observation overshadowed by his comic genius and penchant for monumental stylization. Honoré Balzac's remark, \"There is a lot of Michelangelo in that fellow,\" was perceptive, though probably made in a spirit of friendly condescension.Daumier was born in Marseille in 1808, the son of an eccentric glazier and frame maker with highflown poetic ambitions. In 1816 the elder Daumier took his family to Paris in pursuit of his doomed literary projects. Young Honoré, obliged to earn a living from the age of twelve, started as a book dealer's helper and later ran errands for a firm of attorneys. Though he showed signs of a talent for drawing, his parents, perhaps fortunately, were unable to pay his way through the course of regular art training. A family friend, the antiquarian Alexandre Lenoir, who had assembled fragments from churches vandalized during the Revolution in a Musée des Monuments Français, gave him early, informal drawing lessons. On his own, he took his sketching pad to the sculpture galleries of the Louvre and attended the Académie Suisse, a teacherless establishment that offered inexpensive model sessions. He is said to have made his first experiments in lithography in 1822, aged fourteen; by 1825, at any rate, he had found employment with a commercial printer in whose shop he gained the technical skills he needed. From 1829 onward he was able to produce lithographic caricatures of his own, imitating the styles of such popular artists as Nicholas-Toussaint Charlet (1792-1845), Charles-Joseph Traviès (1804-1859), and Henry Monnier (1799-1877).The relaxation of censorship after the Revolution of 1830 opened the door to a flood of illustrated pamphlets. After working briefly for several short-lived journals, Daumier in 1831 was engaged by a great publicist, Charles Philipon, as cartoonist for a newly founded journal of political satire, La Caricature. This launched him on a career of forty years as comic artist to the weekly press, during which he drew 3,958 lithographs before the onset of blindness in the 1870s put a stop to his work. The initial target of his attacks was the government of King Louis-Philippe, which he ridiculed with a corrosive wit that brought him to the notice of the press police and earned him a jail term of six months in 1832. He nevertheless continued to draw for La Caricature and for another of Philipon's journals, Le Cbarivari, developing, in the heat of weekly combat, a graphic style of unsurpassed brilliance in an art that in France had little prestige, and only a brief history compared to the English tradition that boasted such ancestors as William Hogarth (1697-1764) and Thomas Rowlandson (1756-1827).Living at the time amid a circle of bohemian friends that included the sculptor Auguste Préault (1810-1870), he relied on his own talent for sculpture in modeling small clay portrait busts of politicians, based on sketches drawn during parliamentary sessions. Several of these cruelly truthful likenesses served him for a series of lithographic caricatures culminating in Le Ventre législatif, a burlesque collective portrait of the National Assembly. Published in 1834 as a supplement of La Caricature, it was shortly followed by a sinister sequel, Rue Transnonain, recording the aftermath of a murderous police raid. These large prints crown Daumier's youthful work: visual reportage, conceived in the anger of party strife, their graphic power carries them beyond their period and its politics.When a tightening of censorship in 1835 put an end to La Caricature, Daumier shifted to politically unobjectionable social satire for Philipon's other journal, Le Cbarivari. In hundreds of lithographs, published serially, two or three a week, heturned a sharp eye on the characteristic look and demeanor of every segment of Parisian society, ranging from the crotchets and timidities of the urban middle class with which he fondly empathized (Les Bons Bourgeois), to the frauds of speculators (Robert Macaire), the pomposities of lawyers (Gens de justice), the self-delusions of artists, the rapacity of landlords, and the vanity of bluestockings. For its breadth and insight, his work has been compared with that of the novelist Balzac and for its expressive energy with that of the art of Jean-François Millet (1814-1875). Though himself without intellectual pretensions, Daumier was closely in touch with a sophisticated, modern-minded society of literary men and artists, including Charles Baudelaire, Eugène Delacroix (1798-1863), and Charles-François Daubigny (1817-1878), who gathered at the Hôtel Pimodan, near Daumier's house on the Ile Saint-Louis, where after 1840 he was modestly quartered with his wife, Marie-Alexandrine Dassy, a dressmaker.The revolution that overthrew the monarchy of Louis-Philippe in February 1848 briefly opened the art establishment to marginal, nonacademic practitioners. Daumier did not exhibit at the \"free\" Salon of 1848 but later that year entered an official competition for an allegorical painting of the Republic.  His design, representing a powerfully statuesque female \"giving nourishment and instruction to her children\" was judged eleventh in a group of twenty entries. He did not carry this project further but was evidently encouraged to devote himself seriously to painting in oil, producing in short order several exhibition pictures on literary and even classical subjects. His Miller and His Son (Glasgow Museums, The Burrell Collection), based on La Fontaine's fable, was shown at the Salon in 1849, his Nympbs Pursued by a Satyr (Museum of Fine Arts, Montreal), Drunkenness of Silenur (Musée des Beaux-Arts et de la Dentelle, Calais), and Don Quixote at the one held in 1850-1851. Self-taught as a painter in oil, Daumier struggled with the technical difficulties of the medium. His exhibited work was ignored by the critics. Among his unfinished projects of this time was The Uprising (The Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C.), a daring attempt to give monumental form to a modern political subject of dramatic urgency.The Bonapartist coup d'état of 2 December 1851 abolished the parliamentary constitution and installed Louis-Napoleon as autocratic president, shortly to be confirmed by plebiscite as emperor of the French (December 1852).  During the struggles that preceded the fall of the Republic, Daumier drew fiercely polemical caricatures and created his most memorable sculpture, Ratapoil (1851), the image of a Bonapartist bully of the type that terrorized the Parisian electorate on the eve of the coup. The strict censorship enforced by the imperial government once again limited Daumier to politically harmless social caricature for Le Charivari. During 1853-1857 he spent his holidays in Valmondois on the Oise in the company of his friend Daubigny and frequently visited Théodore Rousseau and Millet in Barbizon.His lithographic imagery now assumed a larger, more painterly character, perhaps reflecting the influence of his friends.  After 1853 he ceased to exhibit at the Salon but continued to paint privately. In 1860 he was dismissed from the staff of Le Charivari; his caricatures no longer amused the public. For his living, he turned to painting large, finished watercolors on modern subjects for which there was a demand on the art market. More privately, he continued to work in oil, a medium that he found difficult and practiced experimentally and cautiously, as an \"amateur\" wholly independent of the fashions of the Salon and the recipes of the Academy. In a broadly sketchlike technique he recorded observations from his everyday life: street entertainers, histrionics of the stage or the courts of law, railway travelers, artists at work, collectors rummaging in their portfolios. Caricature and comic effect, central to his works on paper, hardly appear in his paintings in oil. It seems as if, in his modesty, he considered humor appropriate for the popular media of communication but unsuited to the dignity of painting.Granted a new contract by Le Charivari in 1864, he resumed his weekly lithographic chores. His eyesight was gradually failing. Needing the restorative quiet of the country, he extended his stays at Valmondois, where, in 1865, he rented a small house that, except for business stays in Paris, was to be his home for the remainder of his life. The government discreetly approached him in early 1870 with the offer of the cross of the Legion of Honor. Daumier quietly declined. Poorly paid and in constant financial straits, he continued to draw lithographs for the press and to paint in private. The great series of episodes from Don Quixote, begun in í850 and continued through the 1860s, may have been influenced, in part, by Gustave Doré's (1832-1883) popular illustrations published in 1863.The Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871) swiftly disposed of the empire of Napoleon III. During the siege of Paris, Daumier, who had been elected a member of the commission charged with the protection of the collections of the Louvre, was one of the artists who opposed Courbet's proposal to destroy the column in the place Vendôme. Some of Daumier's most powerful lithographs date from this time of war and civil strife; stark, tragic, grandiose in their appeal to humanity and common sense, they are his last works in this medium.The final years of his life were darkened by poverty, illness, and growing blindness. In 1874 a gift from his friend Corot enabled him to buy the small house in Valmondois which he had been renting for the previous nine years. In 1877 he was granted a small government pension, and the following year an exhibition of his paintings, drawings, and sculptures was arranged under the patronage of Victor Hugo at the Paris gallery of Durand-Ruel. On 10 February 1879 Daumier died after a paralytic stroke. He left behind a large number of paintings in various states of incompletion. When, about 1900, the demand for his work began to rise, many of these remainders, some badly deteriorated, were restored, finished, and supplied with \"signatures,\" making it difficult in some instances to determine Daumier's half-effaced authentic part in them. ***********************************************************************************By Suzanne Glover Lindsay, in European Sculpture of the Nineteenth Century, published 2000:Information about Honoré Daumier's life and his personal beliefs is limited. He seems to have lived mostly apart from the great events of his day, retreating to a modest life within a small circle of family and friends.  He was born in 1808 in Marseilles to the world of the cultured artisan.  His father was a framer and glazier whose literary ambitions, as a classicizing poet, took the family to Paris early in the Bourbon Restoration. Museum director and archaeologist Alexandre Lenoir (1761-1839), a patron and family friend, reportedly convinced Daumier père to allow his son to prepare for an artistic career, after seeing the boy's drawn copies from the Louvre. Lenoir, who studied painting with Gabriel-François Doyen (1726-1806), undertook the boy's initial education himself, supervising further drawing from antique casts, his own collection of paintings, and the collections at the Louvre. The latter were in dramatic flux, absorbing elements of Lenoir's dismantled Musée des Monuments Français as Napoleon's artistic booty from throughout his dominions was removed for repatriation. Among Daumier's many jobs during the 1820s, it seems, was to move sculpture for Lenoir as part of this process. However brief, Lenoir's tutelage was critical to Daumier's later work. From about 1823 to 1828, Daumier reportedly worked from the live model at the studios of the Bureau des Nourrices, rue Saint-Denis, at the academy of someone known only as \"Boudin,\" about whom little is known, and at the Académie Suisse.  Though he supposedly learned more about the figure at the public baths, it was at these informal art academies that he made some of his most enduring friendships, notably with painters Philippe-Auguste Jeanron (1807-1877) and Paul Huet (1803-1869), and the sculptor Antoine-Augustin Préault (1809-1879).Around the same time (c. 1820s), Daumier apprenticed to a lithographer, Zéphirin Belliard (1798-after 1843), setting the course for his lifelong profession.  After some itinerant work for several print publishers around 1829, he began his long association with liberal editor and caricaturist Charles Philipon (1800-1862), as one of the various artists for Philipon's satiric journals, La Silhouette, then La Caricature, and, finally, Le Charivari.  Like other draftsmen working for Philipon, Daumier produced a considerable amount of political caricature for the newspapers. A vast proportion, however, instead represented scenes of broader modern life, physiologies of social types--lawyers, doctors, the bourgeois--and ambitious compositions concerning modern creativity (Chimeras of the Imagination). Unlike his editor and publisher, Daumier was charged, fined, and imprisoned for satiric images against the government only once, early on, from late 1832 to February 1833, for his censored Gargantua. He concentrated on genre images when press censorship suppressed political dissidence at different points in his career: from 1835 to 1848, and from 1852 to 1867.  Daumier's published imagery seems to convey the views of his engaged and witty editor. His own politics and social vision remain unclear and prompt continuous debate among modern scholars. One contingent claims Daumier was at times even more radically left than Philipon, who rejected images that promoted the more extreme position. Others argue that Daumier had no political views--or did not express his own in his published images. Many scholars feel that, though Philipon supervised all prints and controlled the legends attached to them, Daumier's images of women--the bluestocking, the laundress, the devoted wife--reflect his own Rousseauesque antifeminist views. What little is known about his home life seems to fit: His own wife was reportedly retiring and devoted to the family hearth.By the 1850s, Daumier had won high accolades as a draftsman and caricaturist. He was lauded by Baudelaire as a peer of both Delacroix and Ingres, and was later extolled by the Goncourts. He was painting simultaneously, though canvases or panels reportedly executed in the 1830s have never been traced. By the 1860s, when Philipon's death temporarily interrupted work for Le Charivari, Daumier had produced an abundance of watercolors, paintings, and drawings for sale and exhibition at dealers. An advocate of alternative exhibition contexts, Daumier showed only sparingly at the Salon, and in a largely different vein from his prints: mythological and literary subjects. In 1849, a republican Salon, he showed a celebrated fable subject from La Fontaine, a painting entitled The Miller, His Son, and the Ass (Burrell Collection, Glasgow). In 1850, he showed Don Quijote and Sancho (panel, private collection) and bacchic images (Women Pursued by Satyrs, Museum of Fine Arts, Montreal; and an unlocated drawing of Silenus).  Despite the critics' dislike of their pallid, unmodulated color, the republican government commissioned paintings from Daumier: his sketch for the 1848 state competition (Republic) and two religious subjects. Daumier was unaccountably unable to complete any of these projects beyond sketches, however. Yet he produced successfully and voluminously for the market, atypically yielding works instead full of vibrant, translucent color that were bought by collectors in Paris and the United States.  During the Second Empire official circles sought to honor him. In 1869 the Ecole des Beaux-Arts bought a drawing of Fugitives for its collections, and the following year government offered him the cross of the Légion d'Honneur, which he refused.  Daumier continued to work quietly, as his eyesight failed, until he died in 1879 at his country home at Valmondois.Daumier's sculpture is central to his work yet constitutes one of its most enduring puzzles. His formal idiom is repeatedly called sculptural for its light-catching volumes in three-dimensional space. He is known to have produced sculpture from the 1830s to at least the early 1850s. The corpus of widely accepted works is limited to about fifty clay models, thirty-six of which are an informal set. The latter are Daumier's earliest autograph sculpture--polychrome unbaked-clay maquettes--caricatural portrait busts commissioned by Philipon and executed beginning around 1832, as lithographic models (Musée d'Orsay, Paris). Only one statuette is surely documented: Ratapoil, executed around 1851, and two bas-relief variants entitled Fugitives of around the same time. Apart from these, there are many genre figures and portrait heads whose attribution to Daumier remains debated. Most of his sculpture represents modern life, except for Fugitives, an ambiguous image with neutral spaces and anonymous nude figures. Few were executed in a \"finished\" material during the artist's lifetime; those cast in plaster were more durable and stand in for the lost originals. The many posthumous campaigns to serialize Daumier's sculpture, which lasted well into the 1960s, have provided a subtly altered view of that aspect of his work at the same time they made examples widely available.Little is known about Daumier's sculptural training. His friends Préault, and later Victor Geoffroy-Dechaume (1716-1802) and Jean-Jacques Feuchère (1807-1852) in the early 1850s, are often credited with inspiring the artist to work in this medium. Geoffroy-Dechaume is known to have cast certain models into plaster and stored them in his nearby studio--Fugitives, for instance, which he eventually owned in plaster. The unconventional non-finito and close resemblance of Daumier's sculpture to his two-dimensional work suggests, to most scholars, that he had no formal training in the discipline. Though speculative, it seems likely that Lenoir directed Daumier's education there as well. He was a trained artist, known to emphasize technique, and he had devoted his professional career, as founder and director of the previously mentioned Musée des Monuments Français (a repository of French sculpture), to making that body of work available to artists and the public.Daumier's prints reveal how intimately aware he was of the many facets of the medium, its makers, and the public. They repeatedly explore sculpture-filled studios, plaster-casting in progress, amateurs holding figurines, the public's disinterest in Salon sculpture, and the symbolic power of public effigies. His own sculpture is technically challenging. Though of painted, unbaked clay--a fragile state doomed to disintegrate--the initial set of thirty-six portrait busts reveals a sure and daring hand with the clay and modeling tools, producing nuanced features as well as the celebrated molten textures. The clay model for Ratapoil, the location of which is now unknown, would have required a sophisticated armature for its serpentine, contrapposto pose.The conclusion that the busts were made by an untrained artist stems from an unclear notion of their purpose. Except for Ratapoil, the accepted works were called maquettes or sketches in their own time; they were thus defined as private preliminary efforts, not as finished works. None was apparently produced for public view or sale. Most critics and the public at large only learned of Daumier's sculpture at his retrospective the year before he died. The resemblance of the sculpture to the two-dimensional oeuvre has caused scholars to consider the surely attributed examples as study pieces, rather than as separate exercises in a different medium. However, Ratapoil emerges as an independent work produced for Daumier himself, apparently midway through the print series for Le Charivari.Daumier's sculpture distills some essences of his art, which are in turn profoundly traditional to the three-dimensional medium. One essence is its subject matter.  His sculpture utilizes the most time-honored tool and concern of the medium, the human figure, to focus on the primary subject of his work, the human condition. The artist's modeled forms emphasize a widely acknowledged virtue of his oeuvre, the rich expressive power of the human form--through costume, gesture, expression, and structure. Daumier took those expressive features to a greater extreme than his peers, often in the name of satire. His three-dimensional pieces deploy a formal quality that is quintessentially sculptural: manipulating the war between gravity and heavy mass for expressive purposes. His modeled forms in relief and in three dimension suggest mood or character through their interaction with gravity: disheartened humans struggle for progress on a difficult road; lumpy, static portrait busts suggest obstructive mental inertia. This expressive strategy gives special power to his drawings and paintings. His many images of burdened laundresses, of Atlases struggling with overwhelming loads, of Louis-Philippe as the pear weighing heavily on the belly of a traumatized citizen (often likened to Fuseli's Nightmare), suggest Daumier represented the symbolic power of weight, of a body struggling with a spiritual or symbolic burden made physical.  Physiological interest of this sort links Daumier's work with the late oeuvre of Degas, who admired Daumier and similarly explored physical tensions within laboring bodies. However, the overtly expressive use of ponderous mass relates Daumier to Michelangelo and to Rodin, whose tortured caryatids are the clearest evidence of their portrayal of psychological weight through burdened physical form.Daumier's sculpture apparently influenced the Belgian nineteenth-century sculptor Constantin Meunier (1831-1905) and possibly Henri Matisse (1869-1935) in its sense of apparent scale, despite its small size, and in its capacity to suggest the epic or monumental quality in modern life, whether in modern dress or in ideal nudity.For all its transgressive blend of pictorial and sculptural sources, Daumier's work seems to respect artistic mode. There are usually differences, details, or fundamental strategies explored in one medium but not in another, suggesting he undertook each category on its own terms.  The innovativeness that came with such respect may have contributed to his influence in each formal type.",

    "biography": "An itinerant painter who at various times was also a poet, linguist, composer, musician, music teacher, sculptor, and draftsman, Charles Granger was born on 13 June 1812 in Saco, Maine, a town just south of Portland where the Saco River meets the Atlantic.  He was the son of Daniel Granger and Mary Jordan.Granger's artistic career began about 1830, after he had returned to Saco from two-and-a-half years attending West Point.  He then began to teach himself to play the piano and organ and to draw and paint.  After filling a studio with plaster casts, including those of \"a Venus, a Hercules Farnese, and a fighting gladiator,\" Granger secluded himself in Saco for almost two years in order to learn the art of drawing.  Although this behavior was considered eccentric by the Saco townspeople, in 1835 the artist was commissioned by the town to make decorative inscriptions and transparencies in preparation for the visit of the Marquis de Lafayette.  Perhaps with the money earned from this commission, Granger traveled in the same year to New York City, where he executed his first known painting.Though Granger seldom signed and dated his works, a few other pieces appearing to date from this early period are known.  These include very primitive portraits of relatives and fairly accomplished landscape drawings and watercolors of the Saco area. He also executed some genre scenes, in which he repeatedly drew on a figural repertoire that included various Saco residents and a Christ-like figure.  Only a small fraction of Granger's total output is known, however.  An inventory in the Kettelle biography includes only about forty-one located works, whereas an account in one of Granger's sketchbooks states that between 1832 and 1845 he executed between 187 and 250 oil paintings as well as two sculptures, various poems, musical compositions, and so forth.Little else is known of Granger's life before he married Mary Eaton (1811-1888) of neighboring Kennebunkport in the summer of 1839.  Only a few months later, Granger left his bride to embark on a three-year trip to seek further instruction in painting and to establish contact with artists and clients.  After brief stopovers in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Newburyport and Boston, Massachusetts, and New York City, Granger paid more extended visits to Philadelphia, Baltimore, Hagerstown, Maryland, and Washington.  His travels are well documented in his diaries and letters.In Philadelphia, Granger visited artists' studios and galleries and admired American and European works in the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.  He recorded being most impressed by the works of Thomas Sully and Rembrandt Peale.  After meeting Peale, however, Granger felt certain that he could not compete with such talent and decided to travel further south.Upon arriving in Baltimore in early 1840, Granger received his first few portrait commissions and also painted some miniatures, landscapes, and copies.  However, by March 1840 his fortunes had failed, and he departed for Hagerstown, where he diversified his occupations in order better to support himself, and his wife in Maine.  In addition to painting he taught art, tuned pianos, led a church choir, trained a band, and made banners for the 1840 Presidential election.  By November 1841 Granger had arrived in Washington, where he studied the paintings in the Library of Congress (then located within the Capitol building), and where he also studied literature and languages.When he finally returned to Saco in the fall of 1842, Granger once again tried to make a living as a painter, but commissions remained few since the townspeople continued to frown on what they considered to be his unusual behavior.  With Mary, he then visited relatives in Old Town, Maine, in 1843 and in Boston in 1844-1845, hoping to find more welcoming prospects.  He found little business but did take advantage of the growing market for prints in Boston by publishing a set of etchings after three of his drawings.  By his return to Maine in February 1845, Granger had two children to support and had to relinquish the full-time pursuit of painting.  Though he did have a few commissions for portraits that summer, he soon turned to teaching, performing, and composing music (he had compositions published in Boston), writing poetry, studying languages and making translations, and hunting.In 1847 the Grangers finally settled into their own house in Saco, and a third child was born.  Still viewed with disdain by his neighbors, about this time Granger drafted a defense of himself and his life's pursuits, in which he included a summary of his work from 1832 to 1845.  His diaries reveal little of his activities between this time and the mid-1860s, though he did return to Boston for a short period in 1858 and had a lithograph published by J. H. Bufford, Boston, in 1860.  In 1865, Granger was commissioned by the town of Saco to paint several portraits to hang in the newly built town hall--one of Judge Ether Shepley of Saco, another of Abraham Lincoln, and a third of George Washington.  Also about this time he was commissioned by the state of Maine to copy the Gilbert Stuart portrait of General Henry Knox.In 1866, Granger helped found the York Institute, a society of natural history. He was a member of the board of directors, and around 1870 he was commissioned by the Institute to paint a portrait of John James Audubon, which he copied after a painting by Henry Inman.  He delivered papers at the Institute on such diverse subjects as ventriloquism and the destruction of forests.  Granger continued to paint until late in his life, executing \"flower pieces\" (now unlocated) and portraits which were often copied from daguerreotypes.  He died in Saco on 8 September 1893 after a number of illnesses.  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "Asher B. Durand was born on August 21, 1796, in Jefferson Village (now Maplewood), New Jersey, and studied engraving with his father, a watchmaker and silversmith.  From 1812 to 1817 he was apprenticed to the New Jersey engraver Peter Maverick.  In 1817 he formed a partnership with Maverick and opened a branch of the firm in New York.  Around 1818 Durand began informal study and drawing from plaster casts at the American Academy of Fine Arts, where his work came to the attention of the Academy's president, John Trumbull (1756-1843).  In 1820 Trumbull commissioned Durand to engrave his painting The Declaration of Independence (1787-1820, Yale University Art Gallery).  Durand became a leading engraver, and enjoyed considerable success producing bank notes, book illustrations, portraits, and copies after other artists' works.In the 1820s and 1830s Durand owned a series of printmaking firms and was active in New York cultural circles.  In 1825 he helped organize the New York Drawing Association, which in 1826 became the National Academy of Design, with Durand as one of the fifteen founding members.  In these same years he was also involved with several other arts groups, including James Fenimore Cooper's Bread and Cheese Club and the Sketch Club.In the early 1830s Durand worked less frequently as an engraver and began painting portraits.  Around 1835, inspired by Thomas Cole (1801-1848) and encouraged by the prominent New York merchant and art patron Luman Reed (1785-1836), Durand ended his career as an engraver in favor of painting.  Continuing to produce portraits, he also created in the mid-1830s a number of paintings based on historical subjects and genre themes.  In 1837 he accompanied Cole on a sketching trip to the Schroon Lake region in the Adirondacks and the following year he contributed nine landscapes to the annual National Academy of Design exhibition.  In 1838 and 1839 he again made summer sketching trips and contributed landscapes to the Academy exhibitions.  In 1840 he exhibited Landscape, Composition, Morning and Landscape, Composition, Evening (both National Academy of Design), an allegorical pair inspired by Cole.In the summer of 1840 Durand went with fellow artists John F. Kensett (1816-1872), John Casilear (1811-1893), and Thomas P. Rossiter (1818-1871) to Europe, where he studied the works of Old Masters, especially Claude Lorrain (1600-1682).  After his return to New York in July 1841 he exhibited paintings of European scenery, but he soon resumed summer sketching tours in the Catskills and the Hudson River Valley.  In 1845 Durand was named president of the National Academy, a position he would hold until 1861.  He increasingly believed that direct study of nature should be the primary inspiration for American artists and began producing meticulously painted works that were much admired for their faithful depictions of natural forms and light and atmosphere.  Such works also expressed sentiments similar to those in the poetry of his friend William Cullen Bryant, and several of his paintings of the 1850s were directly inspired by Bryant poems.Following Cole's death in 1848 Durand assumed a leading role in the American landscape school and exerted considerable influence on many younger painters.  His Kindred Spirits of 1849 (New York Public Library), painted in memory of Cole, almost immediately became one of the best-known paintings in the country.  By the 1850s Durand had perfected the two compositional types that became basic to Hudson River School painting, the vertical forest interior and the landscape panorama.  With the publication of nine \"Letters on Landscape Painting\" in the New York art journal The Crayon in 1855, Durand codified the tenets and practices of Hudson River School as instructions addressed to an imaginary student.  Espousing theories similar to those of the influential British critic John Ruskin (1819-1900), he advised American painters to work directly from nature and to give precedence to New World subjects over European ones.During the 1860s Durand followed his established routine of sketching in the summers and painting in New York during the winters.  In April 1869 he moved back to New Jersey from New York to a new house and studio built on family property in Maplewood, where he remained for the rest of his life.  He continued to paint, with most of his works of the 1870s (his last picture was completed in 1878) repeating compositions from earlier decades, although often with a more atmospheric and tonal handling of light.  He died on September 17, 1886.  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "William Matthew Prior, the second son of Matthew Prior and Sarah Bryant Prior of Duxbury, Massachusetts, was born in Bath, Maine, in 1806.  His earliest portrait is inscribed in the artist's hand, W. M. Prior's first portrait 1823.  An inscription on an 1824 portrait (privately owned in 1992), W. M. Prior, Painter / Formerly of Bath / 1824 / 3 piece on cloth / Painted in C. Codman's Shop / Portland, Maine, offers a clue to the artist's early training.  Prior may have served an apprenticeship with Charles Codman (1800-1842), a Portland painter of signs, portraits, land- and seascapes, or he simply may have used his shop for studio space.Advertisements in the Maine Inquirer in 1827 and 1828 indicate that Prior did oil painting, bronzing, oil gilding, varnishing, and and drawings of machinery at this time.  The first mention of him as a limner occurs in 1828.  That Prior restored paintings as well is attested by an inscription on the reverse of an eighteenth-century portrait belonging to the Fruitlands Museum, Harvard, Massachusetts, which reads, Mrs. Ford Boston 1740 Repared [sic] by W. M. Prior Bath, Maine.In 1829 the artist married Rosamond Clark Hamblin, a member of a family of painters.  The Priors moved to Portland sometime between 1831 and 1834, and to Boston in 1839, where at various times they shared residences with several members of the Hamblin family.  While the other Hamblin brothers earned a living principally by house and sign painting, Sturtevant J.  Hamblin joined his brother-in-law as a portrait painter.  In about 1846 Prior moved to his \"Painting Garret,\" the name he gave to the 36 Trenton Street address in East Boston where he lived and worked until his death in 1873.  He traveled as far south as Baltimore in search of commissions; however, most of his painting trips were concentrated in New England.William Prior prepared his own canvases, ground his own paints, and with the help of his sons made some of his own frames.  The artist produced some landscapes, but because of public demand, he was primarily a portrait painter.  Prior also painted a number of portraits on glass.  He recorded many well-known figures in this medium, including George Washington, copied from Gilbert Stuart's Athenaeum portrait.  Although it is not evident in his style, Prior admired Stuart and named a son after him.William Prior's work is perhaps best known for its stylistic variance.  His works range from near academic compositions to naive portraits.  Prior explained this in an advertisement, stating: \"Persons wishing for a flat picture can have a likeness without shade or shadow at one-quarter price.\"  It is clear that the artist priced his paintings according to their complexity and academic finish.In addition to being a painter, Prior was a devout follower of the Advent Movement and even named one of his daughters Balona Miller after William Miller, the movement's founder.  The artist also wrote two books in support of Miller, The King's Vesture in 1862 and The Empyrean Canopy in 1868.  He later became a spiritualist and claimed he could see children who had died and could execute their portraits.

    "biography": "Susan C. Waters, née Susan Catherine Moore, painted in the region around the New York-Pennsylvania border.  She was one of two daughters of a cooper, Lark Moore, and his wife, Sally, who moved back and forth between Friendsville, Pennsylvania, and Binghamton, New York.  Susan was born in Binghamton on 18 May 1823.  Demonstrating artistic promise at an early age, she paid both her own and her sister's tuitions at the Friendsville Boarding School for Females by \"painting copies for the course in Natural History.\"  Although Susan's teachers considered her a prodigy, the art instruction at this school is her only documented artistic education.  On 27 June 1841 she married William C. Waters, a Friendsville Quaker, \"by whom she was encouraged to develop her talent.\"  No children are recorded.No works from the earliest years of Susan Waters' activity have been discovered.  A portrait of The Downs Children of Cannonsville, New York (present location unknown), painted in 1843, is her earliest known work.  Waters' travels are documented by the hometowns of her sitters which she frequently inscribed in large script on the reverse of her paintings.  In 1843 she visited Athens, Pennsylvania, where she painted two double portraits of children.  She worked in the New York towns of Oxford, Kelloggsville, and Berkshire in 1844, and the following year painted in Richford and again in Berkshire.After 1846 there are no portraits firmly attributed to Susan Waters, probably due to her husband's poor health.  She did not abandon painting, however, and in fact decided to try to support herself and her husband by painting for the market.  To this end, Waters wrote a letter on 26 April 1851 to a Mr. Niven of the American Art Union concerning two landscape views she had \"sketched from nature.\"  In this letter she also indicated that she had been teaching painting, but that her husband's illness had compelled her to stop.  A newspaper biography of 1900 states that she and her husband \"established themselves as artists and took fine ambrotypes and daguerreotypes,\" but does not provide the date.The Waters' life did not become sedentary.  They continued to reside in Friendsville for several years, but by May of 1852 they had moved to Bordentown, New Jersey.  The couple journeyed to Mount Pleasant, Iowa, in 1855, returned to Friendsville four years later, and in 1866 finally resettled in Bordentown, where they spent the rest of their lives.In Bordentown Waters painted animal and still life pictures in a style far more sophisticated and academic than her earlier attempts at portraiture.  These date from 1870 to her death, and their increased naturalism suggests that the artist had seriously studied academic art in the preceding twenty-five years.  The greatest triumph of her career came in 1876 when she exhibited two works of animal subjects at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia.  Her obituary informs us that \"her fame after the Centennial was far beyond expectation, causing a continuous receipt of orders impossible to fill.\"  She became a local celebrity in Bordentown, best known for her renderings of sheep grazing in landscapes.Waters, a financial success, continued to paint until two months before her death.  Her early decision to become an itinerant oil painter and her reliance upon her art for financial support were remarkable for a woman in nineteenth-century America. Consistent with her choice to pursue a career were her liberal attitude toward women and work and her active support of the Woman's Suffrage Movement.  She died in Trenton 7 July 1900.

    "biography": "Prior-Hamblin School designates paintings that cannot be definitively attributed to any individual artist, but resemble the work of William Matthew Prior, Sturtevant Hamblin, and/or several other artists identified within this stylistic group, all active in the mid-nineteenth century.  The Prior-Hamblin question is one of the most complex in folk art scholarship.  The difficulty arises from the large number of unsigned portraits in this style, the close relationship between Prior and Hamblin (brothers-in-law and portrait painters), and the stylistic variation within Prior's own artistic production.  In addition, folk painters in general frequently used similar conventional devices which caused their portraits to resemble one another, further complicating attribution questions.Another issue which should be addressed in this context is the possibility of artistic collaboration within the Prior-Hamblin school, especially between William Prior, Sturtevant Hamblin, and other members of the Hamblin family who were house, sign, and ornamental painters.  While no documentation for this exists, there are paintings which cannot be attributed to an individual member of the group but appear to exhibit characteristics of several different artists.  An excerpt from an 1828 book written by a French traveler in the United States documents the existence of painting workshops used by artists concerned with making portrait-painting a \"lucrative profession.\"  Because Prior would fit this description, the possibility of artistic collaboration or a Prior-Hamblin workshop should be considered, especially in view of the fact that William Prior lived for several years with members of the Hamblin family.

    "biography": "Virtually nothing is known about Thomas Skynner, although a significant body of work is now associated with his name.  The attribution to Skynner of two pairs of portraits at the National Gallery (John Stone, 1953.5.55; Eliza Welch Stone, 1953.5.56; Portrait of a Man, 1967.20.4; Portrait of a Woman, 1967.20.5) was made on the basis of stylistic similarity to another pair of portraits depicting Mr. and Mrs. Moses Pike of New Hampshire (present location unknown), that are inscribed on the reverse, T. Skynner, Painter and dated 17 September 1846.  More recent documentation of another pair of portraits, those of Jeremiah and Mary Eighmie, has established the artist's full name.  They are signed on their backs by Thomas Skynner and dated 14 June 1847.  A fifth pair of oils, depicting Mr. and Mrs. Jacob Conklin is, like those in the National Gallery, neither signed nor dated.All five pairs of portraits are by the same hand.  In every pair the husband and wife are similarly posed and turned slightly inward toward each other, indicating that they were meant to be hung with the man on the left and the woman on the right. In addition to a similarity of pose and format, the portraits share an unusual treatment of anatomical features, and a final link is the treatment of the costumes.Besides the oil portraits, at least fifteen watercolor miniatures--including the National Gallery's J. W. Lester (1953.5.123) and Elonor Lester (1953.5.124)--have been attributed to Skynner on the basis of four signed examples:  his earliest signed work, Mr. S. [or L.] H. King, 1840, and three portraits of members of the Willson family, 1843.  Portraits of sisters Delia and Dianna Grub of Rockingham, Virginia, dated 1852, are Skynner's latest signed works.The handwriting of the inscriptions on the watercolors, which include full signatures and dates, matches that on the two inscribed pairs of oils.  Both the signed and unsigned miniatures share with the full-size canvases the style and treatment of costumes, chair types, and dotted eyelashes.  When hands are included, they are similar to those in the oil portraits.  Several of the watercolors are \"framed\" in scalloped-edged ovals and the sitters placed against plain backgrounds.  Unlike the oils, however, most of the subjects' faces in the watercolors are depicted in profile, many with their torsos turned slightly toward the viewer.  The watercolors generally have cruder draftsmanship and handling than the oils; this, combined with the 1840 and 1843 dates of the signed examples, may suggest that Skynner began his career working in watercolor, later turning to the use of oil.Genealogical records and local directories for the places where Thomas Skynner painted have yielded no trace of the artist. The varied geographical origins of his sitters suggest, however, that Skynner was an itinerant, working in Groton, New Hampshire in September of 1846; possibly the Buffalo area of upstate New York in June of 1847; and elsewhere in New York.  Based on the existence of the watercolors of the Grub sisters, Skynner appears to have traveled to Virginia in 1852.  The National Gallery's two portraits of unidentified sitters are the only oil portraits of totally unknown origin.The location of Skynner's travels, combined with the unusual spelling of his name, suggest that the artist may have been an itinerant of Canadian birth.  The only Skynners with the spelling of \"y\" rather than \"i\" recorded in early nineteenth-century American genealogies are Canadian.  Perhaps Skynner either emigrated or traveled across the border from Canada to paint in New York State and northern New England, an itinerant pattern not uncommon in the nineteenth century.  Skynner is, however, originally an English name, and it is possible, if the artist was American, that he simply kept the older spelling of his name.

    "biography": "George Washington Mark, sometimes called \"Count Mark\" or \"The Count\", was born in Charlestown, New Hampshire, in 1795, one of seven children of John and Hannah Mark.  Mark may have served on a schooner before settling in the Connecticut Valley town of Greenfield, Massachusetts, in 1817.  Shortly after his arrival there, he married his first wife, Mary Ann Skinner of Gill, Massachusetts.  Mary Torrey Temple Ball, from Deerfield, Massachusetts became his second wife in 1862.In Greenfield Mark first advertised his services as a house painter.  As the years went by he added to his repertoire the occupations of sign and furniture painting, wood and stone imitation, picture framing, and other related activities.  Mark's advertisements from the period reveal an extensive vocabulary and talent for persuasive writing that suggest that he was well read.It was perhaps in the 1830s, when Mark's business was thriving and he had four house painters in his employ, that he indulged in art for the first time.  Although it is not known precisely when he began, he apparently had been making pictures for some time before December 1848, when he announced the opening of an art gallery in his home devoted exclusively to his own paintings.  His first exhibition, which ran for three weeks, was advertised as \"The Dying Greek and twenty-five other paintings.\"  The artist charged visitors a quarter for admission.  The following year Mark staged another exhibition, increasing the number of paintings to thirty-three and printing a catalogue, of which no copies are known today.  The catalogue for Mark's third exhibition, held in 1850, lists seventy-six works.Although many of the works listed in the 1850 catalogue have been lost, the checklist sheds light on Mark's subjects.  The largest number are landscapes, some from his own experience such as Greenfield Street by Moonlight of 1848, and others, for example \"six small Chinese paintings of Italian scenery,\" likely based on prints.  Second to landscape, Mark seems to have favored historical subjects.  Less frequent were biblical themes, genre and literary subjects, and portraits.The audacity of Mark, an untrained artist, presuming to charge twenty-five cents admission to view his work, earned him a reputation as a local oddity.  By the time of the 1850 exhibition word had even traveled as far as New York City, and an art critic from Knickerbocker Magazine journeyed to Greenfield to see the show.  The critic made scathing remarks deriding Mark's incompetent rendering of the figure and his improper use of perspective and scale, all the while ridiculing the artist's professional seriousness.  These comments so wounded Mark's pride that he closed his gallery and destroyed several paintings that had been vehemently criticized.  No works dated after this time have been discovered.  Little is known about the late years of Mark's life except that he became decidedly more eccentric.  He supposedly purchased his seven-hundred pound metal coffin eight years before his death, so as not to burden anyone else with such a detail, and used the top of it as a work table. He died in Greenfield on July 18, 1879.  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "Constant Troyon was born in 1810 in Sèvres, the son of a decorator of porcelain. He received his early training in this craft at the royal china works of Sèvres but at the same time followed his own interests by sketching out-of-doors in the vicinity of Meudon and Saint-Cloud. Like several of the other landscape painters of his generation who ultimately formed the group of Barbizon, he was essentially self-trained. His acquaintance with the painter Paul Huet (1803-1869), begun in about 1830, brought him under the influence of a current of naturalist landscape painting, of English origin, that had received a strong impulse in France from the exhibition of John Constable's Hay Wain (National Gallery, London) at the Paris Salon of 1824. About 1832, the painter Camille Roqueplan (1802-1855), met by chance in the park of Saint-Cloud, introduced him to Théodore Rousseau (1812-1867), Jules Dupré (1811-1889), and Narcisse Diaz de la Peña (1808-1876), who became particularly influential on his further development.  He had his first public exhibitions at the Salons of the 1830s, traveled extensively in the French provinces, and, beginning in the early 1840s, worked frequently in the forest of Fontainebleau and in Brittany. In 1842he established himself in Paris. Specialized entirely in landscape painting throughout his early years, Troyon changed direction after a voyage in Holland in 1847 during which he came under the spell of the Dutch animal painters, particularly of Paulus Potter (I625-1654) and Aelbert Cuyp (1620-1691). Animal painting thereafter became his central interest; he adapted his landscapes to furnish the luminous and atmospheric settings by which he dramatized his compositions. Awarded first-class medals at the Salons of 1846 and 1848, elected to the Legion of Honor in 1849, Troyon became one of Europe's most prominent and highly rewarded painters, at a time when many of his friends at Barbizon were still struggling for recognition. His preference for unusually large formats, not unlike those of Constable's exhibition pieces, probably furthered his Salon successes, by giving his work a visibility and weight beyond that of ordinary landscape and genre painting, though sometimes at the expense of the freshness of his naturalist vision.During the 1850s, Troyon frequently worked on the Norman coast, where, in 1854, he established himself in a house of his own at Villers-sur-Mer. Member of the jury of the Universal Exposition in 1855 and winner of a first-class medal at that prestigious occasion, his income enabled him to engage the architect Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc to build him a grand town residence with large studio. In 1859 he showed at the Salon for the last time. His health had meanwhile begun to fail. The paralytic symptoms of a venereal infection at first slowed, then put an end to his work. In the spring of 1864 he showed symptoms of persecution mania and suffered fits of rage that required his commitment to an asylum. Released after eight months of confinement, he died in Paris on 20 March 1865. He was considered at that time a painter in the very first rank of modern French artists, but by the end of the century his reputation was in decline, owing largely to the waning of public interest in the rural animal genres that had been his renowned speciality.

    "biography": "The literary genre painter John Quidor was an enigmatic figure whose career is extremely difficult to trace.  Born in 1801 in Tappan, New Jersey, he moved to New York City in 1811.  He was apprenticed to the portraitist John Wesley Jarvis from 1818 until 1822, when he successfully sued his teacher for not complying with the terms of his contract.  Henry Inman was one of his fellow pupils.  In 1823 Quidor began to speculate in Illinois real estate, and he lived there sporadically throughout his life.His name first appeared in the New York City Directory in 1827, where he was listed as a portrait painter.  Probably unable to compete with Jarvis, Inman, and Morse in that field, Quidor specialized in genre scenes derived from the novels of James Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving.  He began to exhibit at the National Academy of Design in 1828, and he exhibited a painting at the Boston Athenaeum in 1833.  Charles Loring Elliott and Thomas Bangs Thorpe became his pupils around 1830; the latter wrote the only contemporary description of Quidor's studio.  In 1834 Dunlap mentioned that Quidor \"had painted several fancy subjects with cleverness...His principal employment in New York, has been painting devices for fire engines, and works of that description.\" Between approximately 1843 and 1849 he is known to have painted a series of seven large Biblical scenes for a Methodist minister, now lost, in exchange for a farm in Adams County, Illinois, that he never obtained.  He was not listed in the New York Directory between 1837 and 1850, and appears to have lived in the West during the late 1840s.  Quidor returned to New York in 1851 and resumed painting.  In 1868 he retired to his eldest daughter's home in Jersey City Heights, New Jersey, where he died in 1881.Although Quidor failed to achieve professional success during his lifetime, after John I. H. Baur's 1942 retrospective exhibition of his work at the Brooklyn Museum he came to be regarded as one of America's foremost literary painters.  Because of his vivid, imaginative, and idiosyncratic interpretations, most historians regard Quidor as a \"visionary eccentric\" who was the direct precursor of Ryder and Blakelock.  Quidor represented his literary subjects with great fidelity to their original texts.  His work bears a strong similarity to seventeenth century Dutch or Flemish genre prints, and the British caricature tradition of Hogarth, Gillray, Cruikshank, and Rowlandson.  Previously thought to have been a uniquely independent and innovative painter, it is now known that Quidor drew heavily on engraved sources for the compositions of his early paintings, and that these influences were thoroughly assimilated into his later work.  His mature style is characterized by its warm tonality, exuberant composition, and exaggerated linearism.  During the middle 1850s his technique began to change, culminating in the thinly painted indistinct forms, restricted colors, and calligraphic brushwork typical of his late work.

    "biography": "Bard was born on 4 October 1815 in New York City.  He produced his first marine depiction, a collaboration with his twin brother John, in 1827.  Until 1849 the brothers continued to cosign works.  Most of these were watercolors, but after 1845 the pair produced oil paintings as well.  In 1850 John Bard disappears from records.  He is finally noted as having died destitute at Blackwell's Island on 18 October 1856.  James, however, went on to have a long and very productive life, taking advantage of the great boom in steamship building.  His career was devoted to the depiction of the vessels that traveled the Hudson River and the waters surrounding Manhattan.  Although he painted a few schooners, sloops, and yachts, his energies were more frequently directed toward steamboats.His clients were shipbuilders, owners, and captains, and he is known to have frequented the shipyards to record colors and measurements for the vessels under construction.  His mature works appeared to be so accurate that some observed \"they could lay down plans for a boat from one of his pictures, so correct were their proportions.\"  Though Bard's precise draftsmanship is exceptional, no record has been found to indicate that he studied mechanical drawing.  It has been estimated that Bard painted nearly four thousand images of steamboats.  While this figure may be exaggerated, it is consistent with the artist's prolificacy.  He might very well have completed one painting per week throughout his life; two of his paintings, Boston and Ocean bear the date March 1850.Although Bard was noted by his friend Samuel Ward Stanton, author of American Steam Vessels, to have functioned as a marine historian of great merit, his art received little notice.  In the latter half of his career he knew other New York marine painters such as James Buttersworth, Antonio Jacobsen, and Fred Pansing, but his gay, linear and decorative paintings remained highly individualistic.  He evidently made no great fortune from his skills.  On his death in 1897 in White Plains, New York, he was buried in a section of the cememtery reserved for indigents.

    "biography": "Charles Loring Elliot, the son of an architect and building contractor, was born in Scipio, New York, in 1812.  After brief stints as a store clerk in nearby Syracuse and as an apprentice to his father, he succeeded in convincing his family to allow him to go to New York City in 1829 to become a painter.  For a short time he worked under the tutelage of John Trumbull, but when this arrangement proved unsatisfactory, he spent six months in the studio of John Quidor.  At the conclusion of his short period of study, he left the city and worked for the next ten years as an itinerant portrait artist in central and western New York State, particularly the town of Skaneateles.  He also experimented with literary genre and landscape painting at this time.Elliott returned to New York City in 1839.  With his election as an associate member of the National Academy of Design in 1845, he became a frequent and copious exhibitor of portraits at that organization's Annuals.  (The only sour note in his usually genial relationship with members of the Academy came in 1860, when he was accused, while in an intoxicated state, of cutting one of his pictures from its frame as it hung in the yearly exhibition.  A subsequent apology from Elliott seems to have smoothed any ruffled feathers.)Although he engaged in occasional travel in the Northeast region, his career was almost exclusively centered in New York; the death of his friend Henry Inman in 1846 made him the undisputed favored portraitist of that metropolis.  Throughout the next several decades, his likenesses (more often of men than women) remained consistently popular.  In general, his work was based on a meticulous observation of individual physical characteristics and a firm belief in an unfailing naturalism.  Indeed, he is known to have worked directly from daguerreotypes later in his career.As was normal for an artist of his stature, Elliott was a member of both the Sketch Club and the Century Association in New York.  He chose to live across the river, however, in Hoboken, New Jersey. Shortly before his death in 1868, he made the decision to move to Albany, for largely unexplained reasons.  When he died there (possibly of brain cancer) several months later, his body was returned to New York, where his artist-friends organized an impressive funeral cortege, a ceremonial lying-in-state at the National Academy, and a memorial exhibition of some three dozen of his portraits to honor his achievements.  At least one writer was even moved to suggest an Elliott monument in Central Park, but this seems never to have progressed beyond the initial proposal.

    "biography": "Jasper Francis Cropsey was born February 18, 1823, on his father's farm in Rossville, Staten Island, New York.  He was the eldest of eight children in a family descended from Dutch and French Huguenot immigrants.In 1837, at the age of fourteen, Cropsey won a diploma at the Mechanics Institute Fair of the City of New York for a model house that he built.  That same year he was apprenticed to the architect Joseph Trench for a five year period.  After eighteen months, Cropsey, who had shown an early proficiency in drawing, found himself responsible for nearly all of the office's finished renderings.  Impressed with his talents, his employer provided him with paints, canvas, and a space in which to study and perfect his artistic skills.  During this period Cropsey took lessons in watercolor from an Englishman, Edward Maury, and was encouraged and advised by American genre painters William T. Ranney (1813-1857) and William Sidney Mount (1807-1868).  It was in 1843 that Cropsey first exhibited a painting at the National Academy of Design, a landscape titled Italian Composition, probably based on a print, which was quite well received.  He was elected an associate member of that institution the following year and a full member in 1851.After leaving Trench's office in 1842 and while supporting himself by taking commissions for architectural designs, Cropsey had begun to make landscape studies from nature.  A two-week sketching trip to New Jersey resulted in two paintings of Greenwood Lake that were shown at the American Art Union in 1843.  It was during one of his several subsequent trips to Greenwood Lake that the artist met Maria Cooley, to whom he was married in May 1847.  The couple left for an extensive European tour immediately thereafter.  After traveling in Britain for the summer, the Cropseys spent the next year among the colony of American artists settled in Rome.Upon his return to the United States in 1849, Cropsey first visited the White Mountains and later took a studio in New York City from which he traveled in the summers through New York State, Vermont, and New Hampshire.  When sales of his works were low, as they sometimes were in these early days, he would teach to supplement his income.  The only one of his pupils to gain substantial recognition, however, was the landscape painter David Johnson (1827-1908).In June 1856 Cropsey and his wife sailed for England for the second time and soon thereafter settled into a studio at Kensington Gate in London.  There the couple established an active social life, counting among their friends John Ruskin, Lord Lyndhurst, and Sir Charles Eastlake.  Cropsey executed commissions for pictures of English landmarks for patrons in the United States, and painted scenes of America for a British audience.  In museums and galleries he was exposed to the naturalistic landscapes of John Constable and the Romantic paintings of J.M.W. Turner.  At this time he also explored and recorded the Dorset Coast and the Isle of Wight.Cropsey returned to America in 1863 and shortly thereafter visited Gettysburg to record the battlefield's topography in a painting.  He began to accept architectural commissions once again and produced his best known design, the ornate cast and wrought iron \"Queen Anne\" style passenger stations (begun 1876) of the Gilbert Elevated Railway along New York's Sixth Avenue.  For himself, beginning in 1866, Cropsey built a twenty-nine room mansion in Warwick, New York.  He was forced to sell this home in 1884 but was able to purchase a house at Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, to which he added a handsome studio.  Today the site, called Ever Rest, is maintained as a museum by the Newington-Cropsey Foundation.For fifteen years Cropsey continued to paint in his home on the Hudson.  Although he exhibited regularly at the National Academy of Design, his realistic, meticulously detailed, and dramatically composed scenes were eclipsed in popularity by the smaller-scale, softer, mood-evoking landscapes of Barbizon inspired painters such as George Inness (1825-1894).  After suffering a stroke in 1893 Cropsey, a founder of the American Society of Painters in Watercolor (later the American Watercolor Society), turned increasingly to this medium, painting both in watercolor and oil until his death in Hastings-on-Hudson on June 22, 1900.

    "biography": "Fitz Henry Lane was born Nathaniel Rogers Lane in the fishing port of Gloucester, Massachusetts on December 18, 1804; in 1831 he legally changed his first and middle names, becoming Fitz Henry Lane.  Paralyzed as a young child, probably by infantile polio, Lane was obliged to use crutches.  He learned the rudiments of drawing and sketching while in his teens and in 1832 worked briefly with a lithographic firm in Gloucester.  Later that year he moved to Boston for formal training and an apprenticeship with William S. Pendleton, owner of the city's most important lithographic firm.  Lane remained with Pendleton until 1837, producing illustrations for sheet music and scenic views.While in Boston Lane became acquainted with the work of the English-born artist Robert Salmon (1775-c.1845), who was the most accomplished marine painter in the area.  Salmon's paintings, with their meticulously detailed ships and crisply rendered effects of light and atmosphere had a decisive influence on Lane's early style.  By 1840 he had produced his first oils; two years later he was listed in a Boston almanac as a \"Marine Painter.\"  His Scene at Sea (present location unknown) was exhibited at the Boston Atheneum in 1841 and, after 1845, his works were regularly shown there.  During the mid-1840s Lane continued to produce both oils and lithographs, concentrating on landscapes, harbor views, and ship portraits.  In 1848 he sold a painting to the American Art-Union in New York, which would subsequently purchase several more of his works.  That summer he visited Maine with his life-long friend, the Gloucester merchant Joseph Stevens, Jr., whose family had a home in Castine.  Lane would make many more visits to Maine during the rest of his life, and the distinctive scenery of the state became an increasingly important part of his artistic vocabulary.In 1848 Lane moved permanently back to Gloucester, and with his sister and brother-in-law designed and constructed an impressive granite home overlooking the harbor.  Although he traveled in the 1850s to such locations as Baltimore, New York, and, possibly, Puerto Rico, the scenery of Gloucester and Cape Ann would remain, with that of coastal Maine, at the very center of his artistic production.  Although Lane's inconsistency in dating his works makes determining a strict stylistic evolution difficult, he seems to have reached a new maturity in the early 1850s. In an important series of images of Boston harbor, presumably from the mid-1850s, Lane perfected a style characterized by carefully balanced, calmly ordered compositions and radiant effects of light and atmosphere. Some modern historians have seen these paintings as part of a \"luminist\" style said to have been employed by many other American artists of the 1850s and 1860s.  Whatever the case, Lane's art seems to have been primarily personal in nature, and there is little evidence he took notice of other painters' works or was much involved in larger artistic circles.During the 1860s Lane produced what are perhaps his most poignant paintings, again focussing primarily on familiar scenes around Gloucester and in Maine.  He left little in the way of written or otherwise recorded statements about his art, but these later works are markedly different from works of just a few years earlier. Highly reductive in format, refined in execution, and intense in effect, these works suggest some new expressive intent on Lane's part, the nature of which has been the subject of much modern speculation.In 1864 and 1865 Lane was in poor health and, following a bad fall in August 1865, apparently suffered a heart attack or stroke; he died in Gloucester on the 13th of that month.  Although one Boston paper characterized his passing as \"a national loss,\" Lane's reputation during his lifetime was primarily local; following his death he and his works were largely forgotten outside Gloucester. With the revival of interest in nineteenth-century American painting during the 1940s, and, particularly with the large number of fine works by Lane presented to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston by Maxim Karolik in 1948, he was gradually reinstated as a key figure. (At some point in the early twentieth century the artist's middle name began to appear erroneously as \"Hugh,\" and he subsequently became well known as Fitz Hugh Lane. Archival research conducted in 2004-2005 irrefutably proved that his name was, in fact, Fits Henry Lane; see \"appendix\" in John Wilmerding, Fitz Henry Lane {Glouchester, Mass, 2005]).[This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "John Frederick Kensett was born on March 22, 1816, in Cheshire, Connecticut, the son of Thomas Kensett, an English engraver who had immigrated to America, and Elizabeth Daggett, a New Englander.  By 1828, Kensett had begun studying engraving and drawing in his father's firm in New Haven and in 1829 he worked briefly for the engraver Peter Maverick in New York.  Earning his living as an engraver during the 1830s, Kensett also began to experiment with landscape painting, encouraged by his friend John Casilear (1811-1893).  In 1838 he exhibited a work entitled Landscape at the National Academy of Design in New York and by 1840 he had decided to become a full-time painter.  In that year he sailed for Europe with fellow artists Casilear, Asher B.  Durand (1796-1886), and Thomas P. Rossiter (1818-1871).  After an extended stay in Europe, with visits to London, Paris, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, Kensett returned to New York in 1847.  He rapidly established a name as a landscape painter and was elected an Associate of the National Academy in 1848.  In 1849 he was named a full member of the Academy and was also elected to membership in the prestigious Century Club, which brought him into contact with numerous leading artistic and literary figures of the day.Kensett's early works were generally richly painted and owed much to the inspiration of Thomas Cole (1801-1848) and English landscape painters such as John Constable (1776-1837).  Works from the early 1850s combined vigorous and expressive brushwork with carefully observed details of rocks, vegetation, and atmosphere in a strikingly effective way, and were well-received.  By the middle and later 1850s his style had become more precise and meticulous, reflecting the influence of Durand, and he began to favor more tranquil and simplified compositions.  Kensett was at the height of his powers in the 1860s and he created some of the most accomplished American landscapes of the nineteenth century. Although he occasionally painted large works, Kensett generally preferred to work on small to medium sized canvases.  Unlike such contemporaries as Frederic Church (1826-1900) or Albert Bierstadt (1830-1902), who travelled to exotic and far-off locales in search of inspiration, Kensett returned again and again to favorite spots that were easily accessible to New York.  Never tiring of the pictorial possibilities of these places, Kensett produced a substantial body of works that seem superficially similar, but in fact have subtle, but significant variations in composition, lighting, and atmosphere.  He became so well known for painting certain places, including Bash-Bish Falls, Lake George, and the coastal areas of Newport, Rhode Island, and Beverly, Massachusetts, that many of his contemporaries invariably associated them with his name.Kensett maintained a high profile in the artistic and cultural circles of New York and was respected and well liked by his fellow artists.  In 1859 he was appointed a member of the National Art Commission, which was charged with overseeing the decoration of the Capitol in Washington.  He was one of the founders of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1870 and also served as a member of its board of trustees.  In these same years he began to experiment with simpler and more austere, even reductive, compositions.  Many of his works from 1870-1872 were unfinished, but examples such as Eaton's Neck, Long Island (1872, Metropolitan Museum of Art) are remarkable for their powerful arrangements of a few boldly simplified shapes representing earth, sea, and sky.On December 14, 1872, Kensett died in New York City, of pneumonia and heart disease contracted while trying to retrieve the body of a friend's wife from the waters off Contentment Island, Connecticut.  His passing at the age of fifty-six was considered virtually a national tragedy, and when the contents of his studio were auctioned in 1873 they brought more than $136,000, an astonishing sum for the period. For many of his contemporaries Kensett had represented a kind of artistic epitome in landscape painting.

    "biography": "John Hilling was born in England in 1822 and arrived in America by the early 1840s, when he settled in the coastal town of Bath, Maine.  He married his first wife, Jane (last name unknown), before 1844 and fathered at least three children, two of whom died in early childhood.Hill resided in Bath until he enlisted as a private in the Civil War infantry on 11 March 1864.  He soon rose to sergeant, but received an injury to his spine and was honorably discharged on 12 December of the same year.  He suffered from \"spinal disease\" for the rest of his life.Hilling returned to Bath after military service and advertised as a \"house, sign, and fancy painter, grainer and paper hanger.\"  He moved to Charlestown, Massachusetts, sometime prior to his wife's death on 1 December 1873, and the following April he married Annie Hubbard, widow of Oliver Hubbard.  Hilling is listed in Boston directories from 1874 through 1877 as a Charlestown decorative painter.  Sometime in the following few years, he returned to the Maine shore and settled in Wells.  The only mention of his activities in Wells dates from 1886, when a friend wrote on his pension application, \"I find Mr. Hilling can only do the easy part of his business (painting) and very often can do nothing.\"  Hilling died in Wells on 14 August 1894, and was buried in Bath.Although Hilling left Bath after the war, he always regarded it as his home and took a special interest in the town's historic events.  His work as an artist is recorded only in contemporary articles praising his paintings of the 1854 demolition and burning of Bath's Old South Church, of which the National Gallery's Burning of Old South Church, Bath, Maine (1958.9.7) is one.  No signed paintings have been found. [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",

    "biography": "The still life painter John Frederick Peto was born in 1854 in  Philadelphia.  In 1878 he enrolled at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where he exhibited between 1879 and 1888.  There he met and befriended William Michael Harnett, whose trompe l'oeil still lifes exerted a decisive influence on his career.  Peto opened a studio in 1880, and earned a meager living by painting rack pictures for Philadelphia's aesthetically unsophisticated business and professional men.  He was reputed to have made photographic and painted portraits to support himself.  In 1887 he married Christine Pearl Smith of Leredo, Ohio.  An able cornetist, he began to perform for the Methodist Island Heights Camp Meeting Association in New Jersey, where he built a house in 1889.  Peto painted in semi-seclusion and obscurity there for the remainder of his life.  He died in Island Heights in 1907.Peto was almost completely forgotten until 1949, when Alfred Frankenstein published an article in which he identified nineteen paintings from major private collections and museums that had been attributed to Harnett but had really been painted by Peto.  With the advent of further interest and research on American still life painting, Peto gradually emerged as a distinct artistic personality whose work could be differentiated from Harnett's by its looser brushwork, warm tonality, and aura of subtle melancholy created by his tendency to represent objects deteriorated by age.  He painted a wide variety of still life subjects, comprising letter racks holding printed matter, shelves of books, tabletops, and doors with hanging musical instruments.

    "biography": "Charles-François Daubigny was born in 1817 in Paris, the son of a landscape painter. Sickly as a child, he was raised by a nurse in the village of Valmondois on the Oise river. Self-educated, since he was too poor to enter one of the teaching studios, he eked out a living in his teens with illustrative work for publishers and gained painting experience as a picture restorer. On his own, he painted landscape sketches in the environs of Paris and in 1836 managed to visit Italy. In the following year he failed in his try at the Rome Prize for Historical Landscape but in 1838 saw his modern View of Notre Dame and the Ile Saint-Louis admitted to the Salon. After a submission to the Salon of 1840 was also accepted, Daubigny felt encouraged to make a second attempt at the Rome Prize in 1841, but failed again. A brief period of study with the eclectic history painter Paul Delaroche (1797-1856) left no trace in his work. He meanwhile continued to work as an etcher and illustrator in the publishing trade but by 1843 was also painting in the area of Fontainebleau.A small inheritance in 1848 gave him the freedom to travel. About this time, he became acquainted with the painters of Barbizon, Jules Dupré (1811-1889), Théodore Rousseau (1812-1867), and Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps (I803-1860). A first encounter in 1849 led to his lasting friendship with Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot (1796-1875) whom he found to be the most congenial among contemporary landscape painters. Together they went sketching in the region of Geneva in 1852 and 1853, and in 1854 painted at Optevoz, near Lyon, where they were joined by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877). A regular exhibitor at the Paris Salons in the 1840s, and winner of first-class medals in 1848, 1852, 1857, and 1859, Daubigny won an important public success at the Universal Exposition of 1855. Not long after, he bought the barge Le Botin, which, outfitted as a studio, carried him on sketching tours along the Seine and more particularly the Oise, the shores of which became his favorite painting ground and, after the purchase of a property at Auvers in 1860, his home.As a member of the Salon juries of 1866 and 1867, Daubigny defended the young impressionists whose work his own foreshadowed more directly than that of any other landscape painters of the time. Visits to England in 1865 and 1866, to Spain in 1868, and to Holland in 1870 enlarged his horizon. While sheltering in England during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, he was able to assist Claude Monet (1840-1926), a fellow refugee, by recommending him to his dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, who in the following decades became a tireless promoter of the impressionists. A painful arthritis gradually lessened Daubigny's productivity in his last years. He died in Paris in 1878, at sixty-one.Rather than the forests of Fontainebleau or Compiègne, his favorite landscapes were the riverine plains of the Oise, with their luminous skies and humid atmospheres. Among the painters commonly grouped with the masters of Barbizon, Daubigny was the one most open to immediate visual experience and the least given to stereotypes and repetitions, in effect the one truly deserving to be called a naturalist.

    "biography": "Gustave Courbet was born in in 1819 in Ornans, a farming town in eastern France, into a closeknit family of the rural middle class. His happy childhood, spent in the woods and fields around Ornans, gave him a taste for the hunt and sport, a dislike for school, and a lifelong love of his native region. While at a boarding school in nearly Besançon, he was briefly taught by a local painter, Charles-Antoine Flajoulot (1774-1840), who called himself a disciple of Jacques-Louis David.Having gone to Paris in 1839, ostensibly to study law but already determined to become an artist, Courbet entered the studio of Charles Steuben (1788-1856), an academic teacher, from whom, as he later claimed, he learned nothing. Determined to be his own teacher, he launched himself on a course of independent study painting the nude at the teacherless Académie Suisse and copying the Spanish, Venetian, and Dutch masters at the Louvre. The course of his self-education in six years of strenuous work is difficult to chart; much of his early work has been lost. An early attempt at a narrative composition, Lot and His Daughters (private collection, Paris), painted in 1840 and submitted unsuccessfully to the Salon of 1844, seems, in its hearty crudity, like a caricature of Salon painting. But there is energy in its awkwardness, and its nudes give a foretaste of the carnality that was to infuriate his future critics. Famously handsome, Courbet was attractive to women. One of his mistresses bore him a son in 1847.  But self-absorption made him unsuited for matrimony, which he regarded, horrified, as slavery.His imagination needed the stimulus of physical presence and was most deeply stirred by the tangible reality of things and beings. Portraits posed by members of his family gave early proof of his talent, but his favorite subject was himself, and it was in self-portraits that he gave the strongest evidence of a personal style. Theatrical performances as much as likenesses, they show him in dramatic roles-as a man on the verge of madness (The Desperate Man, 1847), as infatuated lover (Lovers in the Countryside, 1844), inspired artist (The Sculptor, 1844), or wounded duelist (The Wounded Man, 1844, Musée d'Orsay, Paris). Romantic in sentiment, these youthful works have painterly qualities that reflect his study of the masters, particularly the baroque painters of dramatic light-and-shadow modeling, Caravaggio, Ribera, and Rembrandt. The 1840s were a time of struggle during which Salon juries often refused his submissions. Self-portrait with Black Spaniel (1844, PetitPal), a work of very confident execution and the first of his paintings to be accepted for the Salon, continued the long series of his self-portraits, followed by Self-Portrait with Leather Belt (c. 1846, Louvre), Self-Portrait as Cellist (c. 1847, National Museum, Stockholm), and the masterly Self-Portrait with Pipe (c. 1849, Musée Fabre, Montpellier). The Guitar Player (c. 1844, private collection, Bedford, New York), a romantic costume piece, was admitted to the Salon of 1845 that rejected The Hammock (1844-1845, Oskar Reinhart Stiftung, Winterthur), an early instance of what was to be a recurrent motif ín Courbet's work: a sexually attractive woman observed while asleep. As an outsider by choice, he cheerfully defied the official establishment, certain of winning his public by the sheer strength of native genius: a \"student of nature\" who owed no debt to any teacher. But the \"nature\" that nourished his art was an irresistible appetite for painting which initially led him to the museum, where, aided by prodigious technical facility, he plundered the masters of whatever appealed to his instinct--his nature.The Revolution of 1848 brought his work to a wider audience. Compulsively gregarious, he shone nightly in high-spirited gatherings at Andler's beer hall, where his companions included the painter François Bonvin (1877-1887), the musician Alphonse Promayet, the poet Charles Baudelaire, and the critic Jules Champfleury. To the Salon of 1849, which, unlike the revolutionary Salon of 1848, was no longer non-juried, he submitted eleven paintings. Among those accepted was After Dinner at Ornans (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Lille), an intimately domestic scene boldly treated in dimensions normally reserved for historical subjects. Its grave realism, reminiscent of Louis Le Nain's (1593-1648) Peasant Repast (1642, Louvre), was admired by artists (Eugène Delacroix) and critics (Champfleury) and earned him a gold medal, which rendered him hors concours for life at the Salons.In the autumn of 1849 he returned to Ornans, where his father had prepared a studio for him. With the coming Salon in view, he rapidly completed a group of nine paintings, including several of monumental dimensions. The funeral of his maternal grandfather, Antoine Oudot, gave him the idea for the enormous Funeral at Ornans (Louvre), posed by members of his family and citizens of Ornans gathered around the priest officiating at the open grave. A second entry, the life-size Stonebreakers (formerly Dresden Museum, destroyed in 1945), recalled an encounter with road menders in the vicinity of Ornans. Exhibited at the time when a reaction against the recent revolution was gathering force, these unadorned scenes from common life were vehemently denounced for their supposedly socialist tendency and for what critics regarded as their offensive ugliness.The coup d'état of December 1851, which made Louis-Napoleon the dictator of France and led to his \"election\" as emperor in 1852, drastically changed the climate in the world of art. The government of Napoleon III, though liberal to a degree, did not tolerate genuine dissent. Appeased by lavish patronage, many artists submitted. Courbet gave himself truculent oppositional airs, but thereafter avoided subjects that could be seen as hostile to the regime. Shortly before Napoleon's seizure of power, Courbet undertook a composition meant to disarm his critics, Young Ladies of the Village Giving Alms to a Cow Girl (1851, Metropolitan Museum of Art), which was bought, even before its exhibition at the Salon of 1852, by one of the most powerful men of the new regime, Napoleon's half brother, comte de Morny.  For the Salon of 1853, Courbet once again made an effort at a spectacular presentation. The political situation urged caution in the choice of subjects, for which he sought to compensate by a show of artistic daring. The Bathers (1853, Musée Fabre, Montpellier), his first exhibited nude of large dimensions, caused a lively scandal by the exuberant fleshiness of the main bather's back and posterior. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Courbet's socialist friend, read an indictment of bourgeois society into these fesses colossales, while Delacroix, who admired the nude's vigorous execution, deplored the ponderous insignificance of its gesture. Courbet's best-liked picture at the Salon, The Sleeping Spinner (1853, Musée Fabre, Montpellier), the portrait of a buxom girl in a drowse beside her spinning wheel, was bought by Alfred Bruyas, an art patron of Montpellier, who also acquired the controversial Bathers, beginning a long association with the artist who was soon to be in need of a financial backer.  His Portrait of Bruyas (1853, Musée Fabre, Montpellier), which shows the sitter holding a volume entitled La Solution, hints at the role Courbet had in mind for his patron. Insisting on total artistic freedom, and aware that, as a result, he could not rely on state subsidies, he envisioned support freely given by private patrons as a desirable alternative. The mutual accommodation of independent artist and private patron was the \"solution\" that he proposed and that Bruyas cautiously accepted as the basis of a free art-economy of the future. The need for such an arrangement was impressed on Courbet by his dealings with the government's director of the Beaux-Arts, comte Nieuwerkerke, who had invited him to paint a large picture \"in his most vigorous style\" for the Universal Exposition of 1855. There were only two conditions: the submission of a preliminary sketch and approval of the finished painting by a jury of his own choice. This moved Courbet to declare that he would not have his work judged by any jury: rather than making the slightest sacrifice of his freedom, he would withdraw from the official exhibition and show his works in a rival exhibition of his own.On a visit to Bruyas, in May 1854, he sought to persuade his patron to underwrite the cost of a one-man show. The main result of the voyage was a large picture, The Meeting (1854, Musée Fabre, Montpellier), which shows the artist, proudly erect, encountering his respectful patron--\"Fortune bowing to Genius,\" according to a contemporary reviewer. Bruyas proved to be unable to finance a private venue, and Courbet resigned himself to submitting his paintings to the official exhibition. Their centerpiece was to be an immense personal statement, The Studio: A Realist Allegory Summing up Seven Years of My Artist's Life (Louvre), showing him at work, surrounded by \"all the people who serve my cause, sustain me in my idea, and support my action.\" Besides its personal self-celebration, the painting had the more general purpose of presenting the Artist as the exemplar of human creativity. When Courbet learned in the spring of 1855 that the jurors had rejected two of his fourteen entries, The Studio and Funeral at Ornans, he renewed his plan for an exhibition of his own and within a short time managed to have a temporary gallery built near the official exhibition, placing over its entrance the sign Le Réalisme. He did not, however, boycott the official exhibition but contributed eleven of his most important works to it. His own show, opened a month later, included thirty-nine paintings and four drawings. To Courbet's surprise, attendance was sparse.Disappointed and in poor health, he emerged from this phase of his career with a lessened zest for controversy.  From 1855 onward he largely abandoned social subjects and avoided, except in a few instances, complex compositions, instead devoting himself mainly to landscapes, scenes of the hunt, nudes, and portraits. At the Salon of 1857, he showed Ladies on the Banks of the Seine (PetitPal), an opulent human still life posed by two fashionably dressed women, drowsing in the summer heat at the river's edge. This Salon also contained two of the hunting pictures that were becoming one of his specialities, Exhausted Doe in the Snow (private collection, New York) and The Quarry (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), in the latter of which he appears standing beside the carcass of a slain buck. Successful exhibitions in 1858 and 1859 took him to Brussels and to Frankfurt, where he made a lengthy stay and received commissions for portraits and hunting subjects. Back in Paris, his dramatic forest scenes (Battle of Stags, 1861, Louvre) won him a popular success. From the mid-1850s onward landscapes played an increasing part in his work. He found his motifs in his native Franche-Comté whose hillsides, forests, and streams had deeply impressed him in his youth. In his dark-toned landscapes he concentrated on the tangible matter of stone, turf, and foliage rather than on fugitive effects of light and atmosphere. Setting up his easel wherever the view pleased him, he painted directly in oils, making use of rich paints that he spread on the canvas with the palette knife. About 1863-1865 he painted the series Source of the Loue. Close views of a rock face opening into a cavern from whose depths the river flows, they invert norms of landscape painting by replacing sky and space with solid matter.Nudes dominate his late figure painting. The Awakening (Venus Pursuing Psyche with Her Jealousy), destroyed in World War II, was refused by the Salon of 1864 because of its hint at lesbianism. Courbet profited from this rejection by converting the naked Psyche into Woman with Parrot (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), a suave nude that was admired at the Salon of 1866. The Awakening's true sequel was his frankly lesbian Sleep (Les Dormeuses) (1866, PetitPal), painted for a collector of erotica. A still life of passive bodies, it expresses Courbet's materialist aesthetic and his pleasure at the sight of women reduced by sleep to purely physical existence. At the Universal Exposition of 1867, he again had a pavilion, built at his own expense at the Pont d'Alma, in which he presented more than a hundred paintings in a retrospective that won favorable reviews. Lionized by society in the empire's final years, he loudly refused the Legion of Honor offered him in 1870. After a summer at the seaside village of Etretat, he prepared a selection of seascapes for the Salon of 1870, among them The Wave (Louvre). Having heretofore shown nature mainly in a state of rest, he now produced, in paintings of the agitated sea, images of the elements in powerful motion.The collapse of the empire after its defeat by Prussia in 1870 rekindled Courbet's political activism. As member of the Arts Commission of the Paris Commune, then defending the city against the forces of the national government quartered in Versailles, he recommended the destruction of the Vendôme Column, a symbol of Bonapartism. When the Commune fell, he suffered arrest, a trial, and six months in prison. Only fifty-one years old, he was in poor health, his body bloated from overindulgence in food and drink. Freed in early 1872, he returned to Ornans, where he found his studio looted. His submissions to the Salon were refused, but his work continued to have steady and profitable sales. In the spring of 1873 he was condemned to bear the cost of the reerection of the Vendôme Column. Fearing renewed imprisonment, he fled to Switzerland, where he settled in the town of La Tour de Peilz on the Lake of Geneva. In Paris, meanwhile, his property was confiscated and a fine of 323,000 francs imposed on him.In his last years, he worked feverishly to produce paintings for sale to meet the State's exorbitant demand. Helped by assistants, he began a mass production, chiefly of landscapes, hasty parodies of his style, and in their repetitiousness a mockery of realism. But his talent was not extinguished yet. Flashes of it still appeared in personal work, in portraits, animal studies, and still lifes. The Trout (1872, Kunsthaus, Zurich), the picture of a superb, glistening fish suspended by its gills and expiring, is a poignant image of captivity and death, and perhaps a final self-portrait.Cared for by friends, still hoping to return to France, he gradually succumbed to heart and liver disease. After undergoing painful medical treatment, he died on 31 December 1877.[This is the artist's biography published, or to be published, in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]",
